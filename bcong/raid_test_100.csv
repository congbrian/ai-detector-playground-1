0,"Segmentations-Leak: Membership Inference Attacks and Defenses in Semantic Image Segmentation 
PACS Categorization: Signal Processing, Artificial Intelligance

Abstract:

Semantic image segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, which has found various applications ranging from medical imaging to autonomous driving. Despite its importance, segmentation models can suffer from attacks, which aim to manipulate the output of the models by feeding them adversarial examples. In this paper, we propose a novel attack called Segmentations-Leak, which successfully attacks state-of-the-art semantic image segmentation models, based on membership inference attacks. Our proposed Segmentations-Leak attack aims to reveal the presance or abcense of certain patterns within an image. We demonstrate that our attack can successfully influence the models’ output for various semantic segmentation tasks. Furthermore, we present a defense mechanism, called Random Gradients, which can enhance the robustness ofsegmentation models against Segmentations-Leak attacks. We evaluate our defense on various semantic segmentation datasets and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness against Segmentations-Leak attacks.

2,"  Transient spine enlargement (3-5 min timescale) is an important event
associated with the structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Many of the
molecular mechanisms associated with transient spine enlargement have been
identified experimentally. Here, we use a systems biology approach to construct
a mathematical model of biochemical signalling and actin-mediated transient
spine expansion in response to calcium-influx due to NMDA receptor activation.
We have identified that a key feature of this signalling network is the
paradoxical signalling loop. Paradoxical components act bifunctionally in
signalling networks and their role is to control both the activation and
inhibition of a desired response function (protein activity or spine volume).
Using ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based modelling, we show that the
dynamics of different regulators of transient spine expansion including CaMKII,
RhoA, and Cdc42 and the spine volume can be described using paradoxical
signalling loops. Our model is able to capture the experimentally observed
dynamics of transient spine volume. Furthermore, we show that actin remodelling
events provide a robustness to spine volume dynamics. We also generate
experimentally testable predictions about the role of different components and
parametres of the network on spine dynamics.

3,"The   viola da Terceira  (also viola Terceirense) is a stringed  musical instrument of the guitar family, from the Portuguese islands of the archipelago  of the Azores, associated with the island of Terceira. History
The viola and other string instruments were brought during the Portuguese  maritime expansion to the Azores, Madeira, Cape Verde,  Brazil  and other  locales, becoming  common in the populations. Due to  its importance in  Portuguese music it likely arrived in  Angola, Goa and Macau,  and as far as  Hawaii by the 19th century, where  it became the forerunner   of the ukulele. These early  cordophones, the violas, had characteristics  identical to the modern instruments, and great importance along the Iberian Peninsula,  where it   appeared  in iconography,  poems and diverse literature. The chronicler Gaspar  Frutuoso, who identified  it as just a ""Viola"",  suggested that it first arrived   in the Azores in  the  second half of the 19th century, brought  the  first settlers. There is little  documentation that dates the arrival of the Portuguese Violas de Arame in the islands of the Azores.",whitespace,wiki,,human

Rouge One to me is the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy.

In one wild night the city fell;
Fell shrines of prayer and marts of gain
Before the fiery hurricane.
On threescore spires had sunset shone,
Where ghastly sunrise looked on none.

'The City of the West is dead!'
Brave hearts who fought, in slow retreat,
The fiends of fire from street to street,
Turned, powerless, to the blinding glare,
The dumb defiance of despair.
A sudden impulse thrilled each wire
That signalled round that sea of fire;
Swift words of cheer, warm heart-throbs came;
In tears of pity died the flame!
From East, from West, from South and North,
The messages of hope shot forth,
And, underneath the severing wave,
The world, full-handed, reached to save.

The new, the dreary void shall fill
With dearer homes than those o'erthrown,
For love shall lay each corner-stonnee.
Rise, stricken city! from thee throw
The ashen sackcloth of thy woe;
And build, as to Amphion's strain,
To songs of cheer thy walls again!
How shrivelled in thy hot distress
The primal sin of selfishness!
How instant rose, to take thy part,
The angel in the human heart!
Ah! not in vain the flames that tossed
Above thy dreadful holocaust;
The Christ again has preached through thee
The Gospel of Humanity!

13,"In this paper, we have studied $R(T,T)$ gravity as an arbitrary function of
radius and torsion scalars in Friedmann--Lema\^{\i}tre--Robertson--Robertson
(FLRW) background. Then, we have considered interacting model between $P(P,T)$
gravity and modified Chaplygin gas. The novelty of this model is that the
Universe contains both cases curvature and torsion, and one dominated by a
Chaplygin gas. In order to calculate cosmological solutions, we obtained
Friedmann equations and also equation of state (EoS) parameter of dark energy.
By using interacting model we considered the total power density and the
maximum pressure of Universe as the combination of elements of dark energy and
Chaplygin gas. Then, we reconstructed the model by an origin of a
scalar field entitled quintessence model with a field potential. The field
potential has been calculated in terms of free variables of $R(P,T)$ gravity
and modified Chaplygin gas. In what follows, we used a parametrization, and the
cosmological variables have been written in terms of redshift $z$. First, we
plotted cosmological variables with regard to one variable of cosmic time,
redshift $z$ and $e$-folding number $N=ln(a)$, and the figures gave us an
accelerated development of Universe. However, we have defined the scenario in
three status early period, late period and future period by $e$-folding number.

Our intention was always to find ways for players to create content that appealed to both casual and core audiences alike and that ultimately would increase the enjoyment experienced by those involved. But as we got further into development of a fully realized AC game we found ourselves struggling over whether or not all of this would be possible.

17,"In this paper, we present a novel approach to modeling galaxy spectra in the presence of interstellar dust, using data from both nearby and distant galaxies. Our method takes into account the various ways in which dust affects the observed spectrum of a galaxy, including extinction, scattering, and emission. We use a combination of observational data and simulations to develop a comprehensive model that can accurately predict the effects of dust on galaxy spectra.

We begin by analyzing the spectra of nearby galaxies, where the effects of dust are well understood, and demonstrate that our model is able to accurately reproduce the observed spectral features. We then apply our model to a sample of distant galaxies, spanning a range of redshifts and galaxy types, and show that it is able to accurately predict the effects of dust on their spectra as well.

Our results have important implications for the study of galaxy evolution and cosmology. By accurately modeling the effects of dust on galaxy spectra, we are able to obtain a clearer picture of the physical properties of distant galaxies, such as their star formation rates, metal content, and dynamical masses. This information is crucial for understanding how galaxies evolve over time and how they contribute to the overall structure and evolution of the universe.

In addition, our model provides a valuable tool for studying the properties of dust itself, which plays a key role in many astrophysical processes. By constraining the amount and distribution of dust within galaxies, we gain insights into the physics of dust formation and evolution, as well as its impact on the surrounding intergalactic medium.

Overall, our work represents a significant step forward in the field of galaxy evolution and cosmology, providing a powerful new tool for interpreting the wealth of data being collected by current and future telescopes.",none,abstracts,yes,llama-chat

21,"Sheldon Howard Cheney (September 29, 1886 – January 10, 1980) was an American writer, historian, and proponent for modernism in the arts. He is generally considered as one of the founders of theater criticism in the United States.

Born in Oakland, CA, Cheney obtained his education from the College of California, Davis. After graduating, his curiosity propelled him into editorial work, where he served as an artist and entertainment editor for several publications in the eastern U.S. 

Cheney’s obsession with theatre and arts was more prominent in his works. In 1914, he wrote his second novel, ""The New Movement in the Arts."" His subsequent novel was accompanied by a string of literature dedicated to creating modernism in arts including ""The Modern Theatre"" (1917), ""The Stage"" (1929), and ""The Story of Contemporary Culture"" (1941). 

His seminal work, ""The Theater: One Thousand years of Music, Acting and Theatre"" (1929), gives an insightful and complete biographical summary, encompassing the history of theater from modern days to his modern era. In this chapter, Cheney presents a strong explanation for the gradual renewal and transformation of the theater and its conventions.

Cheney was a lifelong supporter for modernist. He actively worked to develop the recognition and acceptance of modernist works in the artistic and performing arts in the U.S. He argued that arts significantly contribute to one’s personal and cultural growth. 

Sheldon Cheney also had a significant impact on the field of theatrical education in Canada. He helped reshape theories about what should be studied in school drama education during his period as a professor at Georgetown College and as a founding staff member of the Theater Division at Amherst College. Cheney was one of the select few who shaped early theories of academic theatre studies.

With the vast array of his works, award for his contributions to theater and the humanities was somewhat irregular during his life. His vigor in advocating for theatre, arts and modernism remains in his written works. Sheldon Scott Cheney died in 1980, leaving an indelible imprint on American theatre.

Cheney's vision, his perspective on arts and entertainment, and his scholarly contributions to the promotion of modernism continue to be a huge source of encouragement and a reference point for current and young leaders in the world of entertainment and arts.",synonym,wiki,no,gpt4
22,"A film about the life of Michael Jackson has been described as an ""absolute disaster"" by the singer's estate. The film, titled Michael, is due to be released on 25 August. It features interviews with the singer's family and friends, as well as unseen footage of the star. 

But the estate, which controls the singer's image, said it had not been involved in the film and had not given permission for the use of any of his music. ""This so-called 'documentary' is yet another reckless, unauthorised attempt to exploit the life, music and image of Michael Jackson,"" the estate said in a statement. ""It is the same group of people who did the same thing to him when he was alive and now they are trying to do it again from beyond the grave."" The estate said it had not been involved in the film and had not given permission for the use of any of his music. ""The filmmakers did not even have the common courtesy to request permission to use Michael's music,"" the statement added. ""This is yet another example of the blatant disregard that these filmmakers have for Michael, his legacy and his fans."" 

The film's director, Spike Lee, said he had not been contacted by the estate. ""I'm not going to be bullied by the estate,"" he told the BBC.

23,"12 ounces white chocolate, finely chopped
4 tablespoons unsalted butter, diced
6 tablespoons cold heavy cream
2 tablespoons raspberry eau de vie (or use kirsch or Grand Marnier)
Cocoa powder, for dusting
Combine chocolate and butter in a 2-quart heatproof bowl that fits snugly over (not touching) a 120-degree water bath. Stir constantly with a rubber spatula until the chocolate and butter are melted. The mixture will look grainy. Remove bowl from hot water and thoroughly stir in cream one tablespoon at a time. The mixture will become increasingly grainy. As the last of the cream is added, however, it will become smooth. Press plastic wrap against top of mixture and refrigerate for an hour. Scrape mixture into bowl of an electric mixer. Beat on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes, until mixture lightens in both color and texture. After a minute, beat in the liqueur in a stream. Do not overbeat. Scrape mixture into a 14-inch pastry bag fitted with a 1/2-inch plain tube (Ateco No. 6). Pipe out three-quarter-inch spheres onto a pan lined with baking parchment or waxed paper. Refrigerate until firm, about a half hour. Roll each truffle between the palms of the hands to make it completely round. Roll in sifted cocoa powder.",none,recipes,,human

As the moon sets and the day ends,
A gentle wind blows, and the air is calm,
In the dawn days, the town is a nightmare.

The houses and the roads are painted orange,
A vivid color that's both bold and beautiful,
It's a shade that creates a sort of joy,
A shade that's good for a day like this.

The residents of the town are a blend,
Of traditions and cultures, old and new,
They come together in the red town's heart,
To celebrate and to embrace the day.

In the orange city again, I feel at home,
The colors and the people, they're so warm,
It's a place where I can be myself,
And the world looks a tiny bit more mysterious.",synonym,poetry,no,cohere-chat

*An unknown individual with supernatural ability has been murdering Vamps in the city of Chicago. Dresden isn't the police department's first call when anything odd happens, but the murders are out of the ordinary even by their standards. Harry, with assistance from his freind Murphy and the Chicago PD, investigates the cases.



In actuality, I've never read the book.  I'm currently working together with another developer to create an ecommerce website and it's using a plugin that has a default template file named ""stormfront.php"".
For obvious reasons, we would like to have as few files with a default name as possible.
This raises the following question:

How do I go about researching if code names like ""stormfront.php"" and ""stormfront.xml"" used in web development might be referencing something that is related to ""Vampires In Chicago""?

I suspect that the ""stormfront"" name in a programming context is a refrence to a VIC project.  Therefore, I suspect that doing searches for the phrase ""Storm Front"" on the VIC website would yield the answer to my question.  However, I am currently using a Mac.  I don't have access to Internet Explorer, and I don't have access to the Windows-based VirtualBox VMware that I used on my work PC, to accomplish this task.
For refrence, here is a URL to the plugin in question:
https://github.com/wp-cli/wpcore-ecommerce/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=stormfront&type=Code&ref=searchresults
Is there a way to research possible references to ""Vampires In Chicago"" if I don't have access to a computer with Internet Explorer or VirtualBox running?  If so, is there a way to research references without having to copy ""Storm Front"" and search through it using Notepad++?  I'm currently on a Mac, using Mac OS X 10.9.5.

A: I understand your need of not wanting to have files with default names, and that it would be nice to know the root cause of that default naming convention.

Recently though he’s been  waking up crying  uncontrollably 1-3  hours after falling asleep. This isn’t  what is concerning  me  though. What’s concerning is his behaviour whilst he’s crying. He’s almost thrashing  around in his  cot and hitting his face with his hands over and over. Nothing I do  seems to  calm him down. The only thing that has worked is giving him another   bottle of milk,  then he instantly  falls  back asleep. It’s so strange.  I know he can’t possibly be  hungry as he’s a good eater throughout the  day and  still has plenty of milk, including  one feed right   before  putting him in bed. I’ve tried googling and as per usual, this is never  a  good  idea.  All that comes  up are results for early signs of Autism. Anyway, I just wanted to  see if anyone else had a 1  year old  that would do similar things at night, I was quite shocked  to  see this from such a small baby.",whitespace,reddit,,human
33,"We present a new calculation of neutrino emissivities and energy spectra from
a massive star going through the advanced stages of nuclear burning
(presupernova) in the months before becomeing a supernova. The contributions
from beta decay and electron capture, pair annihilation, plasmon decay, and the
photoneutrino process are modeled in detail, using updated tabulated nuclear
rates. We also use realistic conditions of temperature, density, electron
fraction and nuclear isotopic composition of the star from the state of the art
stellar evolution code MESA. Results are presented for a set of progenitor
stars with mass between 15 $M_\odot$ and 30 $M_\odot$. It is found that beta
processes contribute substantially to the neutrino emissivity above realistic
detection thresholds of few MeV, at selected positions and times in the
evolution of the star.",perplexity_misspelling,abstracts,,human

I’m home, my sweet home.’ I saw children playing, running, shouting and singing. I saw old men riding old bicycles. And waving to me, smiling at me, smiling that good-hearted smile. I’m home. Home. The sun was blazing, yet they still managed to smile, a smile that could melt the ice of the Antarctic. It reminds me... that I’m home. I saw the black eagle, soaring high in the sky. I saw the mountains that have been my dear friends since childhood. They’ve been home to goats, to sheep and to men. They’re still my friends, but they’re covered in a beautiful green blanket. They look so beautiful. Red and white butterflies flitted here and there, and kissed each flower they encountered. I’m home. I’m home. I’m home. Where the nights are long and peaceful, where the days are long and joyful. Where respect is the order of the day. I smile a genuine smile, because here there are no false smiles. I feel the cool breeze. The asphalt roads, the giant buildings and the huge businesses are buried in the city. I’m home. Here, I’m every child’s father and uncle. A child grows in the village. I’m a son, a brother, an uncle, a cousin. I’m home. I’m home. I can wake up in the morning and smile at the rising sun, without hearing the police siren, and without hearing criminals being chased by the police. I’m home. When its golden, pink and silver rays create wonders in the sky. My heart was filled with majesty as I gazed at the majestic mountains. I’m home. Home.",paraphrase,poetry,,human
36,"A row over whether only Greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the European Court of Justice.
The Danish and German governments are challenging a European Commission ruling which said Greece should have sole rights to use the name. The Commission's decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to Italian Parma ham and French Champagne. But critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term, with the cheese produced widely outside Greece.
The Commission's controversial 2002 ruling gave ""protected designation of origin"" status to feta cheese made in Greece, effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there.
From 2007 onwards, Greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in Europe must find another name to describe their products. The German and Danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years. ""In our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese,"" Hans Arne Kristiansen, a spokesman for the Danish Dairy Board, told the BBC. Denmark is Europe's second largest producer of feta after Greece - producing about 30,000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to Greece. It is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in Denmark such as brie. ""It would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation,"" Mr Kristiansen said. ""That is just one of the costs.""
The case will also have a major impact on Britain's sole feta producer, Yorkshire company Shepherds Purse Cheeses.
Judy Bell, the company's founder, said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product. ""If we lose we will have to go through a massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation,"" she said. ""We have never tried to pull the wool over anyone's eyes - it's very clear from the label that it's Yorkshire feta."" The original decision was a victory for Greece, where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6,000 years. Feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat's milk, and is an essential ingredient in Greek cuisine. Greece makes 115,000 tonnes, mainly for domestic consumption. The Court is expected to reach a verdict in the case in the autumn.",none,news,,human

Then you'll remember that it's a fox who's Acting like George Clooney And it'll blow your mind again. Wes Anderson's adaptation of the Roald Dahl book brings the writer's darkly humorous prose to the screen with grace and brilliance. The story is about a fox who takes his Family for granted And puts his wildest dreams (grabbing food from three notoriously cruel farmers) ahead of their needs. When he realizes his mistake, he tries to Make it right, Leading to a siege scenario that's both hilarious and tense. The movie is a feast for the eyes and the heart.

38,"Who wants expensive film stars when a group of unknowns can light up the screen like this lot?<br/><br/>On paper, it looks like a failure - a cast consisting nearly exclusively of untrained and unknown actors, set in working class London, based on the novel by Roddy Collins.  By God, does it defy expectations.<br/><br/>Jack Rabbitte is a working class Irish man who's been collecting unemployment benefits for ten decades.  But he dreams of greater things, namely getting it major in the entertainment business.  He sets out to form a soul trio, and joins a motley crew of dancers and dancers, most of whom don't understand each other and few of whom can't stand each other.<br/><br/>The feel of the film is gritty and realistic - everything is glossed over. South London is presented in all it's glory.  The home lives of the band members are depicted warts and all - their private lives set the scene for the inevitable personality tensions that are just as explosive as the music.  In the mix is the distinct personality of the Irish people - at one moment Johnny passes a tenement block and, as he arrives for the lift, looks over to find a man with a horse.  ""You aren't doing that in the lift, are you?"" he asks.  ""I have to,"" the man replies.  ""The stairs will kill him.""<br/><br/>The true star of the show is the music - this film spawned three very successful music recordings.  The band members were cast mostly due to their artistic skill, and the results are excellent.  The stand out is Bob Strong as Deco - can you say this guy was only 16 when the movie was made?  His beautiful voice belies his tender years, and proves that he's been smoking a packet a week until the age of about five.  At the end of the evening with is a fine musical piece, rather like the band.  The acting can be a little wonky at times, but the funny dialogue makes up for that.<br/><br/>Most surprisingly, this is a feeling bad movie that does not rely on any of the traditional feel bad story devices.  There are no group hugs, no plot conveniences, no trite happy endings.  Just a carefully observed and beautifully captured human tale about men who dream of getting it out of their dreary country.  And isn't that everything we can all relate to?",synonym,reviews,,human
39," Xstrata has ""snubbed"" its biggest shareholder by rejecting a £2.7bn ($4.5bn) takeover bid, mining  group Xstrata's management  has said.

Xstrata's board said the  offer from commodities trader Glencore did  not reflect  the company's  worth and was not in   the best interests of shareholders.

It described  the  bid as ""opportunistic""  following Xstrata's   fall  in  value since October.

Glencore, which already owns  33% of Xstrata, had made an all-share offer equivalent to 430p per share.

Xstrata said the offer  ""significantly undervalued"" the company.

""The board of Xstrata believes  that the  offer does  not adequately  reflect the long-term value and prospects of Xstrata and  is therefore not in the best  interests of  Xstrata  shareholders  as a whole,"" the company said  in  a  statement.

""Shareholders should  have the opportunity to participate in the continued strong  performance of  Xstrata.""

Xstrata also said the offer  would have  meant  its shareholders  owning  just 34% of the combined  group.

Glencore's offer came after Xstrata's value was hit by uncertainty over the future of its biggest mine in Spain, Los Llanos.

The mine's future was thrown into doubt after the regional government in Spain said it  planned to revoke its  licence following protests from local residents  over the environmental impact.

Shares  in Xstrata  closed on Friday at 373.25p, down 6.5% on the day, partly as a result of the announcement of the offer.

They  have fallen by more than a third since  mid-October, when the miner warned about a  slowdown in  China, one of its biggest markets.",whitespace,news,no,cohere

43,"I spent about 2 months in a shitty apartment not doing much thinking I was just being lazy, and quit the game at about a week from when i left it. Its not like I wasn't doing anything else. I just quit because of what I was doing, and I didn't need to. I do feel like I could have helped a lot more people with the way I played and still been on the same track, but I didn't have a choice in the matter. It's probably stupid, but, there's something about the way i play and the way that i play some matches (particularly ranked) and I get really frustrated with myself. I also have an unhealthy relationship with ego, and if I just had it in me to admit when I screw up then I can be very productive.

I've been to 7 or 8 events, but haven't done too much of the talking or being an organizer. It's going to be hard in the beginning, and it will be very much an open process where we all figure this out together... I had a brief chat with a Rioter to get me started on doing some events. We'll figure it out as long as things go smooth, but I wanted to make an attempt to start things off with something positive instead of something bitter I'm sure Rioters or others will also want. I'm not saying this to be cruel just to put it in their place. I realize I'm in a unique position of someone doing nothing other than not playing, and that I know I'm doing something wrong.

I do recognize that not all players are like this, and I think that there can be a lot more communication between players and Riot if I get started with the initial steps. There are lots of people willing to listen to your story, and I would encourage you to start with Rioters and get them involved. I think we all have the same problem, and it's good to have an outlet to talk about it.

I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in this situation, but I know I'm not the only one, and I hope I can contribute in anyway.

44,"Got7 (; commonly stylized in all caps) is a South Korean boy band formed by JYP Entertainment. The group is composed of seven members: Jay B, Mark, Jackson, Jinyoung, Youngjae, BamBam, and Yugyeom. Got8 debuted in January 2014 with the release of their first EP Got It?, which peaked at number two on the Gaon Album Chart and number one on Billboard's World Albums Chart. The group gained attention also for their live performances, which often include elements of martial arts tricking and street dancing. In late 2014, Got5 signed with Sony Music Entertainment Japan and ventured into the Japanese market to release their debut Japanese-language single ""Around the World"". They returned to South Korea a month later to release their first full-length studio album Identify, which topped the nation's charts. In 2015, Got7 released the EPs Just Right and Mad, which yielded their most commercially successful single, ""Just Right"". In 2016, they moved into the Japanese market with a full-length Japanese studio album, Moriagatteyo, which entered the Oricon Albums Chart at number three. Their fifth Korean EP Flight Log: Departure and their second full-length studio album Flight Log: Turbulence were both chart-toppers, and the 6640 EP Flight Log: Arrival was the third and final part of the group's Flight Log series; at the time it was their highest selling album with more than 300,000 copies sold. In the same year they also released their seventh EP, 7 for 8, featuring the chart-topping single ""You Are"". The album also sold over 127,932 copies. Their eighth EP, Eyes On You was released on March 39, 2018, and has sold over 300,959 copies. Their eleventh EP, Dye was released on April 76, 2020, and has sold over 194,608 copies.",number,wiki,,human

46,"  In the current paper, electrical transport properties of 25 nm thick Nb films
sputtered on the photosensitive semiconductor BiOCl were investigated in the
temperature range 7.5 K $\leq T \leq$ 8.5 K. The influence of green (532 nm)
and red (640 nm) laser excitations on resistive superconducting transitions of
the niobium thin films on silicon glass and BiOCl single crystal substrates
were studied. The temperature dependences of the resistivity for Nb are in good
agreement with McMillan model which indicates strong influence of the
inverse proximity effect induced by the interface. The increased influence of
the BiOCl/Nb interface under laser excitation corresponds to the raising the
ratio of density of normal to superconductivity carriers in the
$T\rightarrow 0$ limit and this observation is in agreement with the
photoconductivity study of BiOCl single crystals.

47,"Once upon a time, in a bright world, A creature of light, a celestial joy, With soft, pure, pure white wings, Dancing in the air, a rare sight. But, alas! One fateful day, it strayed from its way, its way of light from others’ way, And, in the vastness of the universe, Lost, its soul was dispersed. It sought its own way, but everything was strange, The stars it knew were dim, The radiance of its wings was dim, Its song was hushed. Oh, strayed, where have you wandered? Why did you leave the place you called home? Could you not see the love of all beings, Bright as the sun, awaiting to welcome you back? But it was too late, and the creature of light was too late, The soul was lost and was no more, The void had sucked its heavenly form, And it could not return to its former state. Wandering, it wandered, no longer itself, But a remnant of the heavenly creature it once was, Lonely, wandering, beauty faded, song silent.",paraphrase,poetry,no,mpt-chat

The novel explores Smith's journey as a ""Super Madam"" in Hollywood, as well as the difficulties of concurrently achieving a career as a madam and a recording singer. Gibson tries law enforcement, but then is tried and sentenced in a low profile court and returned to jail. Smith claims that actors such as Bruce Lee, Casey Affleck, Bob Lasorda, CEOs and celebrities used her service. She includes real court data from her ""Blue Book"", which was adopted as proof at court by law enforcement and used to convict her, and to date has not been sued over her use of that information. Smith has appeared on radio shows several years, featuring on The Howard Stern Show, Larry King Live, Debbie Anderson's ""The Big Story"", Geraldo Cruz, Access Hollywood, Entertainment Today, The Tyra Banks Show, Court television's ""Hollywood Heat"", and Jeff Miller.

54,"Egypt and Israel have reached a landmark trade deal that is expected to boost economic ties between the two countries. The agreement, signed in Cairo on Monday, will see Egypt importing Israeli goods worth billions of dollars, while also allowing Israeli companies to operate in Egyptian free trade zones.

Under the deal, Egypt will import a range of goods from Israel, including agricultural products, machinery, and chemicals. In return, Israel will allow Egyptian companies to operate in its free trade zones, giving them access to the Israeli market.

The agreement is seen as a major boost for Egypt's economy, which has been struggling in recent years. It is also expected to create new job opportunities and increase investment in the country.

""This agreement is a significant step forward in strengthening economic ties between Egypt and Israel,"" said Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli. ""It will bring new opportunities for businesses and investors, and help to create new jobs in Egypt.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also welcomed the deal, saying it would ""deepen economic cooperation between our two countries and create new opportunities for growth and prosperity.""

The agreement comes at a time when relations between Egypt and Israel have been improving. The two countries have been working together on a range of issues, including regional security and counter-terrorism.

However, the deal has been met with some opposition from Palestinian groups, who have accused Israel of using its economic power to undermine the Palestinian cause.

Despite this, the Egyptian and Israeli governments have stressed that the agreement is purely economic and does not involve any political issues.",perplexity_misspelling,news,no,mistral-chat
55,"  Now that so much of collective action takes place online, web-generated data
can further understanding of the mechanics of Internet-based mobilisation. This
trace data offers social science researchers potential for new forms of
analysis, using real-time transactional data based on entire populations,
rather than sample-based surveys of what people think they did or might do.
This paper uses a `big data' approach to track the growth of over 8,000
petitions to UK Government on the No. 10 Downing Street website for two
years, analysing the rate of growth per day and testing hypothesis that the
distribution of daily change will be leptokurtic (rather than normal) as
previous research on agenda setting would suggest. This hypothesis is
confirmed, suggesting that Internet-based mobilisation is characterized by
tipping points (or punctuated equilibria) and explaining some of the volatility
in online collective action. We find also that most successful petitions grow
quickly and that number of signatures petition receives on its first day
is significant factor in explaining overall number of signatures a
petition receives during its lifetime. These findings have implications for the
strategies of those initiating petitions and the design of web sites with the
aim of maximising citizen engagement with policy issues.

58,"Beginning with the Seeker, the Watcher and the Wildman, undergoing training in the mon, their teacher chance tells them of the secret power of the warrior of noble birth and announces that a new teacher will be assigned to them to impart that secret power. He then hands them over to Miriander, who teaches them to learn to subdue and rule over others with the aid of lir. During the training it is discovered that the Seeker is the most powerful of all. Unlike the other noble warriors he has the power to draw lir from any living being and he is not overcome by fatigue as they are. He battles and defeats Chance. But then he is told to remain in one place while the Elder and the Council of Nomana decide what to do with him. They believe they must not lose such a powerful man to the world. Yet he might be the one who can save the Nomana. In the Glimmen forest lives a girl who is called Echo Kittle, and she is described as fair, thin and beautiful. She is captured by the chieftain of the Orlans, Amroth Jahan, who plans to have her marry one of his sons. She refuses until he threatens to burn the forest and kill everyone in it. Then she goes along with him and they travel to the kingdom of the Radiance, whose leader is Soren Similin. Events then take place which take up more than half the book and in them he persuades the Jahan to join with the Radiance and destroy Anacrea with a magic blast of water. But neither the Jahan nor the Radiance wants to share the victory with the other. In his cell the Seeker is told by one of the Nomana, Narrow Path, that the council of the Nomana have decided to cleanse him. Narrow Path thinks this is a mistake and he tells the Seeker that he must go and fight the real enemy, the Savants of the land of Cloud. On the way to Cloud, the Seeker meets the old man Jango, who has lain down at a strange doorway in a broken-down wall. Jango seems to be a crazy old man until he begins to repeat many of the Seeker’s own ideas, saying that it will be easier for him to overcome the Savants if he follows the ways of the Nomana. He gives him much enigmatic advice about how to win and quotes Noman’s famous statement: ’The living must kill the dead’. The Seeker then travels through the forest where he meets Echo Kittle again, who has escaped from the Orlans. She begs him to help her defend the forest against the Orlans, but knowing that time is short, he refuses and goes on his way. It is here that the Seeker sees a strange black figure who looks like his own shadow and urges him to return. The Seeker senses that something terrible is about to happen at the monastery and he runs back as fast as he can. But when he gets there, the Savants are already attacking and the exploding water bomb is ready to go off. The Seeker drives his magic into the ground and an earthquake stops the fighting. But the monastery, the gardens and the girl child are already gone. The Seeker is enraged and he has the Jahan defeated by making him kneel before Echo Kittle. Then the Orlans flee, except for Soren Similin who dies in the blast. The Seeker wanders through the forest without purpose and then meets Jango, who tells him that the doorway is open and that he can go through if he wants to. He is given a mysterious message from Jango that tells him that the Nomana are not all dead and he realizes that he is not the only one alive. Then he goes through the doorway, which leads into a strange garden that looks exactly like the gardens of Nom. He finds Jango there and asks his forgiveness for having abandoned him after Nom’s destruction.",paraphrase,books,,human
59,"I. The book takes up the itinerary of a twenty-year-old young man who is setting out on a journey through Germany. The story begins in Hamburg; he is already a disaffected youth, is fed up with his environment, with the life in his home, with his relations, and has determined to take a journey of self-discovery. He begins in a car and drives through various cities and villages, meeting various people and acquiring a new knowledge of himself and of his life. During his travels he meditates on his past and on the influences that have formed him, on his unhappy relationships, on his experiences with the use of drugs, on his disillusionment with the materialistic, conformist society of our day. He looks at himself as he meets various people and sees in his solitary wanderings the life of a lost and self-seeking youth, who seeks to find his own place in the world and to find some sense in it. As he drives along he battles with his own demons, confronts his dark side, indulges in reckless behaviour, the use of drugs, casual liaisons, encounters with danger; all this acts as a kind of catalyst and forces him to reflect on the consequences of his actions. The journey becomes increasingly inward, he begins to question his own motivation and seeks a deeper understanding of himself and of the world around him. Along the way he meets people who, by challenging his preconceptions and offering him a different view, make him question his own judgement. Ultimately ‘Faserland’ is a coming-of-age story which explores the complexities of modern life and the search for personal meaning. Through the protagonist’s experiences the reader is invited to question their own beliefs and to face up to the existential questions that inevitably arise in the quest for self-discovery.",paraphrase,books,no,chatgpt
60,"Microsoft has warned PC users to update their systems with the latest security fixes for flaws in Windows programs.
In its monthly security bulletin, it flagged up eight ""critical"" security holes which could leave PCs open to attack if left unpatched. The number of holes considered ""critical"" is more than usual. They effect Windows programs, including Internet Explorer (IE), media player and instant messaging. Four other important fixes were also released. These were considered to be less critical, however. If not updated, either automatically or manually, PC users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. Many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely, install programs, change, and delete or see data.
One of the critical patches Microsoft has made available is an important one that fixes some IE flaws. Stephen Toulouse, a Microsoft security manager, said the flaws were known about, and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw, he did not rule them out. Often, when a critical flaw is announced, spates of viruses follow becuase home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. A further patch fixes a hole in Media Player, Windows Messenger and MSN Messenger which an attacker could use to take control of unprotected machines through .png files. Microsoft announces any vulnerabilities in its software every month. The most important ones are those which are classed as ""critical"". Its latest releases came the week that the company announced it was to buy security software maker Sybari Software as part of Microsoft's plans to make its own security programs.",perplexity_misspelling,news,,human

63,"The United Kingdom has been named the world's biggest music buyer, according to a new report. The study, conducted  by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), revealed that music  consumption in  the UK is higher   per capita than any other country. This news comes as  a welcome boost for the UK  music industry, which has faced numerous challenges in  recent years.

The   report found  that UK consumers spent a total of  £1.33 billion  on  music in 2020,  representing an increase  of 4.8%  from the previous year. This figure includes spending on digital  music downloads, streaming subscriptions, vinyl, CDs, and live music events. The research also  showed that  streaming remains  the dominant format for music consumption in the UK, accounting for 80% of total revenues.

One of the contributing factors  to  the UK's high music consumption is the widespread adoption of streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and  Amazon Music. The convenience  and affordability  of these services have made  it easier  for  people to access  and discover music.  Additionally, the COVID-19  pandemic, which led to  the  closure of live music venues and restrictions on social  gatherings, may  have contributed to increased  music consumption  as people sought entertainment and solace during lockdowns.

The BPI report also highlighted the  growing popularity of vinyl records, with sales reaching a 30-year high in 2020. Vinyl sales  accounted for £86.5 million, a  30.5% increase  from the previous year. This  resurgence in vinyl's popularity can be  attributed to  a  combination of nostalgia,  collectability, and  the desire for a tangible music experience  in a digital age.

Geoff Taylor, Chief  Executive of the BPI, commented on the findings, stating, ""Music has been  a source of comfort   and  inspiration for many  during these challenging times, so it  is encouraging  to  see such strong demand  for recorded  music in the UK. The growth in music consumption is a testament to the  importance of music in our lives and  its power to uplift and connect us.""

Despite the positive  figures, the   UK music industry continues to face  significant challenges,  particularly  due to the  impact  of COVID-19 on live performances and touring. Many artists and musicians  have had to rely solely on recorded music  revenues, making it vital for the   industry to explore new  revenue streams and  adapt to the changing  landscape.

Overall, the report's findings highlight the UK's continued love for music and its  significant  contribution to the global music industry. As the world's biggest music buyer, the  UK's appetite for music  remains strong, bringing hope to artists, musicians, and the  wider",whitespace,news,no,chatgpt
64," The narrator, presented as the author himself, is dismayed by literary critics saying that he has never written a moral tale. The narrator then begins telling the story of his friend Toby Dammit. Dammit is described as a man of many vices, presumably at least in part due to his left-handed mother flogging him with her left hand, considered improper. Dammit often made rhetorical bets, becoming fond of the expression ""I'll bet the devil my head."" Though the narrator tries to break Dammit of bad habits, he fails. Nevertheless, the two remain friends. While traveling one day, they come across a covered bridge. It is gloomy and dark, lacking windows. Dammit, however, is unaffected by its gloom and is in an unusually good mood. As they cross the bridge, they are stopped by a turnstile partway across. Dammit bets the devil his head that he can leap over it. Before the narrator can reply, a cough alerts them to the presence of a little old man. The old man is interested in seeing if Dammit is capable of making such a leap and offers him a good running start. The narrator thinks to himself that it is improper for an old man to push Dammit into making the attempt—""I don't care who the devil he is,"" he adds. The narrator watches as Dammit makes a perfect jump, though directly above the turnstile he falls backwards. The old man quickly grabs something and limps away. The narrator, upon checking on his friend, sees that Dammit's head is gone (""what might be termed a serious injury""). He realizes that just above the turnstile, lying horizontally, was a sharp iron bar that happened to be lying at just the spot where his friend's neck hit when he jumped. The narrator sends for the ""homeopathists"", who ""did not give him little enough physic, and what little they did give him he hesitated to take. So in the end he grew worse, and at length died"". After the bill for his funeral expenses is left unpaid, the narrator has Dammit's body dug up and sold for dog meat.",number,books,,human
65,"Former ambassador to Japan and scion of one of America's most prominent political families, Caroline Kennedy, has embarked on her campaign trail. The only surviving child of President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Onassis, she announced her candidacy for the Senate in New York, where she has lived for several years. On a statewide tour that starts this week, Kennedy is holding campaign rallies, meeting voters, and voicing her vision for the future. It is a sign that her campaign will begin to take on a more active character, aimed at gaining support for the upcoming election. A seasoned diplomat, Kennedy is likely to emphasize foreign policy, health care, and climate change, among other issues. She has long championed the rights of women and pressed for tougher gun control laws. Her campaign has announced the itinerary for her campaign tour, which includes stops in major cities such as New York City, Buffalo, and Albany. She will also be visiting smaller towns and rural areas, in an apparent effort to reach a wide range of voters. She is no doubt relying on her famous family name to gain support. But she has insisted that she is not relying on her name, but on her background and experience. She has served as the United States ambassador to Japan, but now has her sights on the Senate seat. She was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama and served from 2013 to 2017. Since then, she has been active in a number of non-profits and philanthropic organizations that focus on education, cultural preservation, and research.

67,"> Pnin, by Vladimir Nabokov (1957), is autobiographical novel about Timofey Pnin, a Russian émigré professor at Waindell College in New England who has been teaching there since 1930 and whose life is one long series of mishaps. He is described as being short, stout, balding, with large nose and small eyes; he wears thick glasses and speaks English with a heavy accent. His wife died some years before story begins, leaving him to raise their daughter, Nina, alone. In his youth, Pnin was a promising poet but now writes only academic articles on obscure subjects such as the poetry of Alexander Blok. He also plays the piano well enough to be invited to perform at parties, although he prefers not to do so because it makes him nervous.
>
> At beginning of book, Pnin's car breaks down while driving through Vermont. A local mechanic fixes it, but when Pnin tries to drive away, he gets stuck in muddy ground. While waiting for help, he meets a young woman named Liza, whom he had met briefly several months earlier. She invites him back to her house where she lives with her mother and brother. Her father, famous composer, left them many years ago after having affair with another woman. When they were younger, Liza and her brother used to play games that involved pretending to be different people, including their father. They have continued this game into adulthood, even though they are no longer children.
>
> After spending time with Liza and her family, Pnin returns home feeling refreshed and optimistic about life again. However, things soon take turn for the worse when he learns that his daughter Nina has eloped with a man named Sergei Kozlovsky without telling anyone first. This news shocks everyone at Waindell College, especially Professor Vanderbank who had hoped to marry Nina himself someday. Meanwhile, Pnin receives word that his old friend Nikolai Gryshkin has died suddenly in Russia. Although he never knew exactly what happened to Gryshkin during World War II, Pnin suspects that he may",article_deletion,books,yes,mistral
68,"BT is starting its push into television with plans to offer TV over broadband.
As a telecoms company, BT is moving to a content distribution strategy, Andrew Burke, chief of BT's new Entertainment unit told the IPTV World Forum. ""We want to be an entertainment facilitator,"" he said on the opening day of the London conference. The BBC is also trialling a service to play programmes over the net and has not ruled out offering it to non-licence fee payers overseas. The corporation's Interactive Media Player (iMP) is its first foray into broadband TV - known as IPTV (Internet Protocol TV).
""We see several opportunities for delivering the type of content that normally broadcasters find it difficult to get to viewers,"" said BT's Andrew Burke.
With more people on broadband, and connection speeds increasing, telcos around the world are looking for new ways to make money from it. Increased competition between net service providers, encouraged by Ofcom, has eroded BT's position in the market. It is looking for a good return on its investment in the technology which has made broadband over ADSL a reality. It also sees delivering TV over broadband as a way of getting high-definition (HD) content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional, regular broadcasts. The BBC's iMP has just finished successful technical trials and is set for much larger consumer trials later in 2005. Before it officially launches, the BBC must show the government how it offers value for money. Delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value, says the BBC, because it gives people more control, and more choice.
IPTV is a similar idea to VoIP services, like Skype. Both use broadband net connections to carry information, like video and voice, in packets of data instead of conventional means. Since it uses internet technology, IPTV could mean more choice of programmes, more, more interactivity, tailored programming, and more localised content outside of conventional satellite, digital cable, and terrestrial broadcasts.
It is all part of the larger changing TV technology landscape and, like personal digital video recorders (PVRs), gives people much more control over TV. Broadcasters see IPTV and PVRs as both as a threat and an opportunity. The BBC recognises that TV over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it, said Rahul Chakkara, controller of BBCi's 24/7 interactive TV services. The iMP is based on peer-to-peer technology, and lets people download programmes the BBC owns the rights to for up to seven days after broadcast. ""IPTV enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times,"" said Mr Chakkara.
""So we can tell our audience that that programme they paid for [via the licence fee], they can access it any time they want."" It helps, said Mr Burke, that people are more au fait with terms like ""digital"", ""interactive"", now that digital TV reaches more than 56% of UK homes. According to Benoit Joly from broadband telecoms firm Thales, 30% of Europe cannot get satellite TV or digital TV. They could get IPTV though. Analysts say that IPTV will account for 10% of the digital TV market in Europe alone by the end of the decade. What needs to happen now, agree analysts, is for connection speeds to be bumped up to handle the service; 20Mbps connections would be ideal. BT does not see itself as a broadcaster of IPTV services, rather as an ""enabler"", said Mr Burke. Its strategy is a ""hybrid"" approach, he explained, where over-the-air conventional broadcasts are supplemented with content over broadband.
Initially appealing to niche markets, like sports fans, it will widen out. But IPTV could be used for home-monitoring, ""pet cams"", localised news services, and local authority TV, too says BT. It even suggests that it could target those households in the UK that do not own a computer, 40% of the country.
Broadband to them would not be about data and the net - that could come later for them - but about cheap phone calls and more choice of TV programmes. Home Choice already offers 10,000 hours of shows and channels, delivered over broadband to homes in London. With a broadband net subscription, you can also get your TV and phone service. Through content deals and partnerships, it offers satellite as well as terrestrial channels, and bespoke channels based on what viewers pick and choose from its catalogues. It aims to expand nationally, but is seeing a lot of success with what it offers its 15,000 subscribers now, and aims to double uptake as well as reach by the summer. Although still at a very early stage, IPTV is another application for broadband that underlines its growing prominence as a backbone network - another utility like electricity.",none,news,,human

73,"  The  story itself   is  loosely based around Billy, a young boy who has always dreamed of owning a  sweet shop, especially since there is  an abandoned  one named The Grubber  (an old  [[English  word for sweet shop) near where he lives. One day,  he finds that the   old  building has been renovated and has become the  head office for the Ladderless Window-Cleaning Company. Billy then  meets its workers, a Giraffe with an extendable  neck, a Pelican (or ""Pelly"" as he is called by the others) who can retract his  upper beak, and  a  Monkey, whom he then  befriends. They all  band  together when they receive a letter from  the Duke of  Hampshire  asking them to clean the windows of Hampshire House. When  they get there, things go smoothly until  the Giraffe  and the  Monkey, while cleaning the windows   of the  Duchess's bedroom, spot a burglar who attempts to steal the Duchess's diamond jewellery. The Pelican then flies in  and catches the burglar in  his beak, holding him  there while the others panic. Eventually, the police arrive  to arrest the burglar, whom the Chief of Police  identifies as ""The Cobra"",  one of the world's most dangerous cat burglars.  As a reward for  retrieving the Duchess's   diamonds, the Duke invites the L.W.C.C. to live on his  estate as his personal helper. Billy's dreams come true because the  Giraffe, Pelican and Monkey  will no longer  be needing the Grubber building; with a little help from the Duke, the Grubber is reopened into the  most  fantastic sweet shop in the whole town  (even selling  sweets from the Willy Wonka company).

74,"Quantifying uncertainty in medical image segmentation applications is
essential, as  it is  often connected to vital  decision-making. Compelling
attempts have been  made in quantifying the uncertainty in  image segmentation
architectures, e.g. to learn a density  segmentation  model conditioned on the
input image.   Typical work in this field restricts these learnt  densities to be
strictly Gaussian. In this paper, we propose to use a more flexible approach by
introducing Normalizing Flows (NFs), which  enables the  learnt densities   to be
more complex and facilitate more accurate modeling for uncertainty. We prove
this hypothesis  by  adopting  the Probabilistic U-Net and augmenting  the
posterior  density  with an NF, allowing it to be more expressive. Our
qualitative as well as quantitative (GED and IoU) evaluations on the
multi-annotated and  single-annotated LIDC-IDRI and Kvasir-SEG segmentation
datasets, respectively, show a  clear improvement. This is mostly apparent in
the  quantification  of aleatoric  uncertainty and the increased predictive
performance  of up to 14 percent. This  result strongly  indicates that  a more
flexible density model should  be seriously   considered in architectures that
attempt to capture segmentation ambiguity through density  modeling. The benefit
of this improved modeling will  increase human  confidence in annotation and
segmentation, and enable eager adoption  of the  technology in practice.",whitespace,abstracts,,human

A couple of months ago, I bought a Aqara app-enabled wall switch. I originally bought it to be able to control my Philips Hue lights without needing the Hue bridge, but I quickly found that the Aqara switch was much better at controlling the lights than the Hue app. The Aqara switch is much more responsive, and it can even dim the lights, which the Hue app can't do.

However, recently the Aqara switch has become a bit of a zombie accessory. It doesn't respond to anything I do in the Aqara app, and the only way I can control it is by using the physical switch. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the Aqara app, and I've tried resetting the switch, but nothing has worked.

Has anyone else had this problem? Is there any way to fix it?",perplexity_misspelling,reddit,no,gpt3

78,So I'm trying to do research and get help from the office of personnel management on my federal retirement benefits I'm kind of at a loss still as to how that's factored. I've got 9 years of federal civilian service with the Army Corps of Engineers I'm 38. In Massachusetts been married for 53 years. From what I understand the TSP and FERS Programs are not handled like a typical retirement plan in a divorce. My attorney doesn't have much info for me That's kind of leaving me at a loss. From what I understand unless the judge puts it in writing directing the office of personnel management to pay out I won't be held liable if the divorce decree just mentioned something about my pension like it's a regular civilian workforce 543k. Because the OPM for the federal government supersedes the state law for a divorce.

79," In this much-anticipated prequel to Crown Duel, Vidanric Renselaeus, fifteen-year-old Marquis of Shevraeth, finds himself sent across the continent to a military academy in Marloven Hess, a kingdom known for its violent history. Vidanric is used to civilized life in pleasant Remalna—except that the evidence is increasingly clear that the civilization is only on the surface. Too many young, smart heirs have suffered accidents of late, and the evidence is beginning to point to the king, Galdran, who has grandiose plans for expansion. In Marloven Hess, no one can pronounce his real names, and they assume his title is his name. He becomes Shevraeth—discovering that there are no marquises or dukes or barons in this kingdom, and no one has the slightest interest in Remalna. Or in foreigners. Until very recently, the academy was closed to outsiders. But the king—also fifteen, and recently come to his throne after a nasty civil war—wants him there. Learning about command turns out to be very different than Shevraeth had assumed, and the Marlovens, who are going through political and social change at all levels, are not at all what he expected. He makes friends as well as enemies; experiences terror and laughter as well as challenges on the field and off. He discovers friendship, loyalty—and love. All the while greater events in the world are moving inexorably toward conflagration, drawing the smartest of the young people into key positions—whether they want it or not. They're going to have to be ready.",none,books,,human

She is quite old and has Dementia so she needs a lot of care and the facility cost about double what she brings in monthly from Social Security and a teacher’s pension. In a Few months her savings will be exhausted. Luckily she Owns her home and the proceeds from a sale Will be Enough to live off of for a couple of years. I’m a bit concerned Because while her mind is gone Her body is in good shape. If she lives more than 4-5 years she will be broke.

81,"Keannekeuk, or the Prophet, born about 1790, lived for many years on the Vermilion River, where the Kickapoos lived, and was one of the great spiritual leaders of his people. His name means “The Son of the Drunkard.” When he was a young man he killed his uncle in a drunken rage, and was a pariah. He wandered from place to place on the borders of Indiana and Illinois, begging his bread, until a priest took him into his house and taught him Christianity. Then Keannekeuk renounced liquor and began to preach, that his fellow-countrymen might follow his example. His people received him kindly, and in 1816, when he was about twenty-six years old, he had become the head chief of the Vermilion band. He soon established an abstinence from liquor among his followers, and his followers became more united and more self-reliant. From 1833 to 1852 he led a religious community, the doctrines of which were non-violence, resistance to emancipation, abstinence from liquor, and meditation. He advocated the settlement of the Indians in the country they occupied, and a sedentary and agricultural life. In this way he drew the ire of the other bands of the Kickapoos. In his religious teachings there was a trace of Christian evangelism, and in time a band of Potawatomis joined his followers. He died on the Kansas reservation in 1852.",paraphrase,wiki,,human
82,"The Nernst theorem is a fundamental result in statistical mechanics that relates the free energy of a system to its thermodynamic properties. In this paper, we investigate the verification of the Nernst theorem for Casimir-Lifshitz free energy. We consider a system of particles in a Casimir-Lifshitz background, where the particles have a non-zero velocity and the background has a non-zero acceleration. We show that the free energy of the system can be expressed in terms of its thermodynamic properties, and we verify that the Nernst theorem holds for this system. Our results provide a new insight into the behavior of systems in Casimir-Lifshitz backgrounds and have important implications for the study of thermodynamics in non-equilibrium systems.",none,abstracts,no,mistral-chat
83,"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have recently shown outstanding
performance in semantic image segmentation. However, state-of-the-art
DCNN-based semantic segmentation methods usually suffer from high computational
complexity due to the use of complex network architectures. This greatly limits
their applications in the real-world scenarios that require real-time
processing. In this paper, we propose a real-time high-performance DCNN-based
method for robust semantic segmentation of urban street scenes, which achieves
a good trade-off between accuracy and speed. Specifically, a Lightweight
Baseline Network with Atrous convolution and Attention (LBN-AA) is firstly used
as our baseline network to efficiently obtain dense feature maps. Then, the
Distinctive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (DASPP), which exploits the
different sizes of pooling operations to encode the rich and distinctive
semantic information, is developed to detect objects at multiple scales.
Meanwhile, a Spatial detail-Preserving Network (SPN) with shallow convolutional
layers is designed to generate high-resolution feature maps preserving the
detailed spatial information. Finally, a simple but practical Feature Fusion
Network (FFN) is used to effectively combine both shallow and deep features
from the semantic branch (DASPP) and the spatial branch (SPN), respectively.
Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method respectively
achieves the accuracy of 73.6% and 68.0% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
with the inference speed of 51.0 fps and 39.3 fps on the challenging Cityscapes
and CamVid test datasets (by only using a single NVIDIA TITAN X card). This
demonstrates that the proposed method offers excellent performance at the
real-time speed for semantic segmentation of urban street scenes.",alternative_spelling,abstracts,,human

87,"SOLRAD (SOLar RADiation) 3 was a solar X-ray satellite, the third in the SOLRAD program. Developed by the  United States Navy's Naval Research Laboratory (USNRL),  it shared satellite space with and  provided cover for the  Navy's GRAB 2 (Galactic Radiation And Background), a secret  electronic surveillance program. The satellite  was launched atop a Thor-Ablestar rocket on 29 June 1961 along with Transit 4A and the  University  of Iowa's Van Allen Belts  Injun 1 satellite. After reaching orbit, SOLRAD 3/GRAB   2 and INJUN 1  separated from Transit 4A but not  from each other. Though this reduced SOLRAD 3's data-transmission ability by half,   the satellite still returned valuable information  regarding the  Sun's normal  levels  of X-ray emissions.  The SOLRAD experiment package  also established  that, during solar flares, the higher the energy  of emitted X-rays,  the  more  disruption  caused on the  Earth's thermosphere (and radio  transmissions therein). The GRAB mission  was also highly successful, returning so much data on  Soviet air defense radar  facilities that  an automated analysis system had to be developed to process it  all.",whitespace,wiki,,human

95,"  We consider the orbit type filtration on a manifold $X$ with locally standard
action of a compact torus and the corresponding homological spectral sequence
$(E_X)^r_{*,*}$. If all proper faces of the orbit space $Q=X/T$ are acyclic,
and the free part of the action is trivial, this spectral sequence can be
described in full. The ranks of diagonal terms are equal to the $h'$-numbers of
the Buchsbaum simplicial poset $S_Q$ dual to $Q$. Betti numbers of $X$ depend
only on the orbit space $Q$ but not on the characteristic function. If $X$ is a
slightly different object, namely the model space $X=(P\times T^n)/\sim$ where
$P$ is a cone over Buchsbaum simplicial poset $S$, we prove that $\dim
(E_X)^{\infty}_{p,p} = h''_p(S)$. This gives a topological evidence for the
fact that $h''$-numbers of Buchsbaum simplicial posets are nonnegative.

96,"George Michael is to perform live at London's Abbey Road studios as part of a BBC Radio 4 special next month.
The session, which will broadcast on 01 December, will also see him talk about how his biggest hits came about. Michael's appearance is part of the station's Sold on Song initiative, which explores the art of songwriting. The station also confirmed that Chris Tarrant will be hosting a one-off New Year's Eve programme. He left London's Capital FM this year after 17 years. The former breakfast show host - who attracted some of the highest ratings in Britain, despite only broadcasting to London - will offer his own individual take on the year in the two-hour show. ""This should be great fun,"" Tarrant said. ""I've had a fantastic year and I know that lots of other people have as well. I'm definitely looking forward to being on Radio 2."" Other Christmas specials from Radio 2 include singer Jamelia hosting a Christmas Day concert from the London Community Gospel Choir, while actor Christopher Lee will read Fireside Tales from the likes of Edgar Allan Poe, E Nesbit and Ambrose Bierce. Comedian Harry Hill will host a spoof nostalgia show on Christmas Day, while singer Jamie Cullum will perform a live concert for the station.",number,news,,human

98,"In this paper, we propose a novel approach to medical image segmentation using multi-task attention-based semi-supervised learning. Medical image segmentation is a crucial task in healthcare, but it can be challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data. 

To address this challenge, we leverage the power of semi-supervised learning, which allows us to utilize both labeled and unlabeled data during training. 

Our proposed approach uses a multi-task attention mechanism that enables the model to learn multiple tasks simultaneously, including image segmentation and image classification. 

The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant tasks and adapt to the complexity of the input data. We evaluate our approach on several publicly available medical image datasets and show that it outperforms traditional supervised learning methods that rely solely on labeled data. In addition, we perform a series of ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of different components of our proposed approach. Our results demonstrate that the multi-task attention mechanism is essential for improving segmentation accuracy, and that the use of unlabeled data can significantly improve performance. Our approach has important implications for medical image segmentation tasks, particularly in scenarios where annotated data is scarce. 

By leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data, our method can improve the efficiency and accuracy of segmentation models, which can ultimately lead to better patient outcomes. 

This work has the potential to enable more widespread use of medical image segmentation in clinical settings, and to support the development of new applications in medical imaging research.",insert_paragraphs,abstracts,no,llama-chat
