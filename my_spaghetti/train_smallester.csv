extensive amount of data generated by today's clinical systems, has led to the
development of imaging AI solutions across the whole value chain of medical
imaging, including image reconstruction, medical image segmentation,
image-based diagnosis and treatment planning. Notwithstanding the successes and
future potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of
the potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are
perceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust
in critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are
currently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI
developments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption.
To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding
principles drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best
practices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These
guiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)
Fairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness
and (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are
further translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying,

heavily depends on a large amount of labeled data to supervise the training. On
the other hand, the annotation of biomedical images requires domain knowledge
and can be laborious. Recently, contrastive learning has demonstrated great
potential in learning latent representation of images even without any label.
Existing works have explored its application to biomedical image segmentation
where only a small portion of data is labeled, through a pre-training phase
based on self-supervised contrastive learning without using any labels followed
by a supervised fine-tuning phase on the labeled portion of data only. In this
paper, we establish that by including the limited label in formation in the
pre-training phase, it is possible to boost the performance of contrastive
learning. We propose a supervised local contrastive loss that leverages limited
pixel-wise annotation to force pixels with the same label to gather around in
the embedding space. Such loss needs pixel-wise computation which can be
expensive for large images, and we further propose two strategies, downsampling
and block division, to address the issue. We evaluate our methods on two public
biomedical image datasets of different modalities. With different amounts of
labeled data, our methods consistently outperform the state-of-the-art

recent advances in deep learning, several deep neural networks for medical
image segmentation have been introduced successfully for this purpose. In this
paper, we focus on learning a deep multi-organ segmentation network that labels
voxels. In particular, we examine the critical choice of a loss function in
order to handle the notorious imbalance problem that plagues both the input and
output of a learning model. The input imbalance refers to the class-imbalance
in the input training samples (i.e., small foreground objects embedded in an
abundance of background voxels, as well as organs of varying sizes). The output
imbalance refers to the imbalance between the false positives and false
negatives of the inference model. In order to tackle both types of imbalance
during training and inference, we introduce a new curriculum learning based
loss function. Specifically, we leverage Dice similarity coefficient to deter
model parameters from being held at bad local minima and at the same time
gradually learn better model parameters by penalizing for false
positives/negatives using a cross entropy term. We evaluated the proposed loss
function on three datasets: whole body positron emission tomography (PET) scans
with 5 target organs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prostate scans, and
ultrasound echocardigraphy images with a single target organ i.e., left

integrative loss function can outperform state-of-the-art methods and results

huge workload. In this study, we present lambda-BCE and lambda-smooth L1loss to
effectively train 3D-CNN by some slices from 3D seismic data, so that the model
can learn the segmentation of 3D seismic data from a few 2D slices. In order to
fully extract information from limited data and suppress seismic noise, we
propose an attention module that can be used for active supervision training

original label, and letting it supervise the attention module using the
lambda-smooth L1loss. The experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of our loss

labels. And it also shows the advanced performance of the attention module,
which can significantly suppress the noise in the seismic data while increasing
the model's sensitivity to the foreground. Finally, on the public test set, we
only use the 2D slice labels training that accounts for 3.3% of the 3D volume

recent Vision Transformer (ViT) and extend it to semantic segmentation. To do
so, we rely on the output embeddings corresponding to image patches and obtain
class labels from these embeddings with a point-wise linear decoder or a mask
transformer decoder. We leverage models pre-trained for image classification
and show that we can fine-tune them on moderate sized datasets available for
semantic segmentation. The linear decoder allows to obtain excellent results
already, but the performance can be further improved by a mask transformer
generating class masks. We conduct an extensive ablation study to show the
impact of the different parameters, in particular the performance is better for
large models and small patch sizes. Segmenter attains excellent results for
semantic segmentation. It outperforms the state of the art on both ADE20K and
Pascal Context datasets and is competitive on Cityscapes."

beyond individual images to further augment the pixel representations. We first
set up a feature memory module, which is updated dynamically during training,
to store the dataset-level representations of various categories. Then, we
learn class probability distribution of each pixel representation under the
supervision of the ground-truth segmentation. At last, the representation of
each pixel is augmented by aggregating the dataset-level representations based
on the corresponding class probability distribution. Furthermore, by utilizing
the stored dataset-level representations, we also propose a representation
consistent learning strategy to make the classification head better address
intra-class compactness and inter-class dispersion. The proposed method could
be effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks (e.g., FCN,
PSPNet, OCRNet and DeepLabV3) and brings consistent performance improvements.
Mining contextual information beyond image allows us to report state-of-the-art
performance on various benchmarks: ADE20K, LIP, Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff."

prior region maps for query images, which locate the objects, as guidance to
perform cross interaction with support features. In such a way, the extraction
of query information is detached from the support branch, overcoming the

computer-aided diagnosis systems for many applications. However, given many
disparate imaging modalities and inherent variations in the patient data, it is
difficult to consistently achieve high accuracy using modern deep neural
networks (DNNs). This has led researchers to propose interactive image
segmentation techniques where a medical expert can interactively correct the
output of a DNN to the desired accuracy. However, these techniques often need
separate training data with the associated human interactions, and do not
generalize to various diseases, and types of medical images. In this paper, we
suggest a novel conditional inference technique for DNNs which takes the
intervention by a medical expert as test time constraints and performs
inference conditioned upon these constraints. Our technique is generic can be
used for medical images from any modality. Unlike other methods, our approach
can correct multiple structures simultaneously and add structures missed at
initial segmentation. We report an improvement of 13.3, 12.5, 17.8, 10.2, and

that hinder their deployment in real-world applications: 1) Predictions lack
uncertainty quantification that may be crucial to many decision-making systems;
2) Large memory storage and computational consumption demanding extensive
hardware resources. To address these issues and improve their practicality we
demonstrate a few-parameter compact Bayesian convolutional architecture, that
achieves a marginal improvement in accuracy in comparison to related work using
significantly fewer parameters and compute operations. The architecture
combines parameter-efficient operations such as separable convolutions,
bilinear interpolation, multi-scale feature propagation and Bayesian inference
for per-pixel uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo Dropout. The best
performing configurations required fewer than 2.5 million parameters on diverse
challenging datasets with few observations."

plays a significant role in several application scenarios including autonomous
driving, land cover classification, and urban planning, etc. However, the
tremendous details contained in the VFR image severely limit the potential of
the existing deep learning approaches. More seriously, the considerable
variations in scale and appearance of objects further deteriorate the
representational capacity of those se-mantic segmentation methods, leading to
the confusion of adjacent objects. Addressing such is-sues represents a
promising research field in the remote sensing community, which paves the way
for scene-level landscape pattern analysis and decision making. In this
manuscript, we pro-pose a bilateral awareness network (BANet) which contains a
dependency path and a texture path to fully capture the long-range
relationships and fine-grained details in VFR images. Specif-ically, the
dependency path is conducted based on the ResT, a novel Transformer backbone
with memory-efficient multi-head self-attention, while the texture path is
built on the stacked convo-lution operation. Besides, using the linear
attention mechanism, a feature aggregation module (FAM) is designed to
effectively fuse the dependency features and texture features. Extensive
experiments conducted on the three large-scale urban scene image segmentation
datasets, i.e., ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, ISPRS Potsdam dataset, and UAVid

of supervoxels into image regions. Here we describe a distributed algorithm
capable of handling a tremendous number of supervoxels. The algorithm works
recursively, the regions are divided into chunks that are processed
independently in parallel by multiple workers. At each round of the recursive
procedure, the chunk size in all dimensions are doubled until a single chunk
encompasses the entire image. The final result is provably independent of the
chunking scheme, and the same as if the entire image were processed without
division into chunks. This is nontrivial because a pair of adjacent regions is
scored by some statistical property (e.g. mean or median) of the affinities at
the interface, and the interface may extend over arbitrarily many chunks. The
trick is to delay merge decisions for regions that touch chunk boundaries, and
only complete them in a later round after the regions are fully contained
within a chunk. We demonstrate the algorithm by clustering an affinity graph
with over 1.5 trillion edges between 135 billion supervoxels derived from a 3D
electron microscopic brain image."

segmentation stage highly relies on the extracted set of spatial features and
the receptive fields. In this work, we propose an end-to-end network, called
Trilateral Attention Network (TaNet), for real-time detection and segmentation

segmentation pathways: 1) handcrafted pathway with hand-designed convolutional
kernels, 2) detail pathway with regular convolutional kernels, and 3) a global
pathway to enlarge the receptive field. The first two pathways encode rich
handcrafted and low-level features extracted by hand-designed and regular
kernels while the global pathway encodes high-level context information. By
jointly training the network for localization and segmentation using different
sets of features, TaNet achieved superior performance, in terms of accuracy and
speed, when evaluated on an echocardiography dataset for cardiac segmentation.

estimates the disparity of the stereo images. The overlapping image patches

aligned based on the photometric consistency presumption. We propose a Bayesian

from the textureless surfaces and the photometric inconsistency caused by the
Lambertian reflectance. Our Bayesian method correctly balances the probability

the estimated depth has higher accuracy and fewer outliers than the baseline

the significant potential of automatic segmentation for tera-scale EM images.
However, none of the existing segmentation methods are error-free, and they
require proofreading, which is typically implemented as an interactive,
semi-automatic process via manual intervention. Herein, we propose a fully
automatic proofreading method based on reinforcement learning. The main idea is
to model the human decision process in proofreading using a reinforcement agent
to achieve fully automatic proofreading. We systematically design the proposed
system by combining multiple reinforcement learning agents in a hierarchical
manner, where each agent focuses only on a specific task while preserving
dependency between agents. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the episodic
task setting of reinforcement learning can efficiently manage a combination of
merge and split errors concurrently presented in the input. We demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed system by comparing it with state-of-the-art
proofreading methods using various testing examples."

proposed segmentation architectures rely heavily on the availability and
fidelity of ground truth labels to achieve state-of-the-art accuracies. Failure
to acknowledge the difficulty in creating adequate ground truths can lead to an
over-reliance on pre-trained models or a lack of adoption in real-world
applications. We introduce Points2Polygons (P2P), a model which makes use of
contextual metric learning techniques that directly addresses this problem.
Points2Polygons performs well against existing fully-supervised segmentation
baselines with limited training data, despite using lightweight segmentation
models (U-Net with a ResNet18 backbone) and having access to only weak labels
in the form of object centroids and no pre-training. We demonstrate this on
several different small but non-trivial datasets. We show that metric learning
using contextual data provides key insights for self-supervised tasks in
general, and allow segmentation models to easily generalize across
traditionally label-intensive domains in computer vision."

learning problems, e.g., image segmentation, community detection, among others.
For a given undirected connected graph, we tackle the statistical problem of
exactly recovering an unknown ground-truth binary labeling of the nodes from a
single corrupted observation of each edge. Such problem can be formulated as a
quadratic combinatorial optimization problem over the boolean hypercube, where
it has been shown before that one can (with high probability and in polynomial
time) exactly recover the ground-truth labeling of graphs that have an
isoperimetric number that grows with respect to the number of nodes (e.g.,
complete graphs, regular expanders). In this work, we apply a powerful
hierarchy of relaxations, known as the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy, to the
combinatorial problem. Motivated by empirical evidence on the improvement in
exact recoverability, we center our attention on the degree-4 SoS relaxation
and set out to understand the origin of such improvement from a graph
theoretical perspective. We show that the solution of the dual of the relaxed
problem is related to finding edge weights of the Johnson and Kneser graphs,
where the weights fulfill the SoS constraints and intuitively allow the input
graph to increase its algebraic connectivity. Finally, as byproduct of our
analysis, we derive a novel Cheeger-type lower bound for the algebraic
connectivity of graphs with signed edge weights."

still challenging to segment the tooth root with a blurry boundary for the

high-resolution segmentation based on polynomial curve fitting with landmark
detection (HS-PCL). It is based on detecting multiple landmarks evenly
distributed on the edge of the tooth root to fit a smooth polynomial curve as
the segmentation of the tooth root, thereby solving the problem of fuzzy edge.
In our model, a maximum number of the shortest distances algorithm (MNSDA) is
proposed to automatically reduce the negative influence of the wrong landmarks
which are detected incorrectly and deviate from the tooth root on the fitting
result. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach not
only reduces Hausdorff95 (HD95) by 33.9% and Average Surface Distance (ASD) by
42.1% compared with the state-of-the-art method, but it also achieves excellent
results on the minute quantity of datasets, which greatly improves the
feasibility of automatic root canal therapy evaluation by medical image
computing."

prior works did not aim for automatic initialization which is addressed here.
In addition to manual initialization, current methods are highly sensitive to
initial location and fail to delineate borders accurately. We propose a fully

pixel of the image towards the closest point on the boundary, the size of which
is equal to the Euclidean distance map. We evaluate our method on four publicly

problem in a progressive manner based on informative words in the expression,
i.e., first roughly locating candidate entities and then distinguishing the
target one. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Progressive Comprehension
(CMPC) scheme to effectively mimic human behaviors and implement it as a CMPC-I
(Image) module and a CMPC-V (Video) module to improve referring image and video
segmentation models. For image data, our CMPC-I module first employs entity and
attribute words to perceive all the related entities that might be considered
by the expression. Then, the relational words are adopted to highlight the
target entity as well as suppress other irrelevant ones by spatial graph
reasoning. For video data, our CMPC-V module further exploits action words
based on CMPC-I to highlight the correct entity matched with the action cues by
temporal graph reasoning. In addition to the CMPC, we also introduce a simple
yet effective Text-Guided Feature Exchange (TGFE) module to integrate the
reasoned multimodal features corresponding to different levels in the visual
backbone under the guidance of textual information. In this way, multi-level
features can communicate with each other and be mutually refined based on the

Existing food image segmentation models are underperforming due to two reasons:
(1) there is a lack of high quality food image datasets with fine-grained

carry coarse ingredient labels or are small in size; and (2) the complex
appearance of food makes it difficult to localize and recognize ingredients in
food images, e.g., the ingredients may overlap one another in the same image,
and the identical ingredient may appear distinctly in different food images. In
this work, we build a new food image dataset FoodSeg103 (and its extension

interpretable results. The proposed framework defines a likelihood appearance
probability and a prior label probability based on a generic shape function
through a logistic function. A reference length parameter defined in the
sigmoid controls the trade-off between shape and appearance information. The
inference of shape parameters is performed within an Expectation-Maximisation
approach where a Gauss-Newton optimization stage allows to provide an
approximation of the posterior probability of shape parameters. This framework
is applied to the segmentation of cochlea structures from clinical CT images
constrained by a 10 parameter shape model. It is evaluated on three different

performances comparable to supervised methods and better than previously

geodesic metrics by which the geodesic distances and the corresponding Voronoi
diagram can be estimated. In this paper, we introduce a type of asymmetric
quadratic metrics dual-front model. The metrics considered are built by the
integration of the image features and a vector field derived from the evolving

shortcut or leakage problems especially when the initial contours are far away

Moreover, object representations are often inferred using RNNs which do not
scale well to large images or iterative refinement which avoids imposing an
unnatural ordering on objects in an image but requires the a priori
initialisation of a fixed number of object representations. In contrast to
established paradigms, this work proposes an embedding-based approach in which
embeddings of pixels are clustered in a differentiable fashion using a
stochastic, non-parametric stick-breaking process. Similar to iterative
refinement, this clustering procedure also leads to randomly ordered object
representations, but without the need of initialising a fixed number of

the confidence is below its associate threshold. The optimal threshold for each

effectiveness to segment unseen object classes with a few annotated samples.
Most existing approaches use masked Global Average Pooling (GAP) to encode an
annotated support image to a feature vector to facilitate query image
segmentation. However, this pipeline unavoidably loses some discriminative
information due to the average operation. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective self-guided learning approach, where the lost critical
information is mined. Specifically, through making an initial prediction for
the annotated support image, the covered and uncovered foreground regions are
encoded to the primary and auxiliary support vectors using masked GAP,
respectively. By aggregating both primary and auxiliary support vectors, better
segmentation performances are obtained on query images. Enlightened by our
self-guided module for 1-shot segmentation, we propose a cross-guided module
for multiple shot segmentation, where the final mask is fused using predictions
from multiple annotated samples with high-quality support vectors contributing
more and vice versa. This module improves the final prediction in the inference
stage without re-training. Extensive experiments show that our approach
achieves new state-of-the-art performances on both PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i

are difficult to obtain, particularly in medical imaging, where annotations
also require expert knowledge. Weakly-supervised learning can train models by
relying on weaker forms of annotation, such as scribbles. Here, we learn to
segment using scribble annotations in an adversarial game. With unpaired
segmentation masks, we train a multi-scale GAN to generate realistic
segmentation masks at multiple resolutions, while we use scribbles to learn
their correct position in the image. Central to the model's success is a novel
attention gating mechanism, which we condition with adversarial signals to act
as a shape prior, resulting in better object localization at multiple scales.
Subject to adversarial conditioning, the segmentor learns attention maps that
are semantic, suppress the noisy activations outside the objects, and reduce
the vanishing gradient problem in the deeper layers of the segmentor. We
evaluated our model on several medical (ACDC, LVSC, CHAOS) and non-medical

models trained with fully annotated segmentation masks. We also demonstrate
extensions in a variety of settings: semi-supervised learning; combining
multiple scribble sources (a crowdsourcing scenario) and multi-task learning

spatiotemporal information of biomedical processes in life sciences. Their
simple structures and semantics provide unique advantages in elucidating
learning behavior of deep neural networks (DNNs). It is generally assumed that
accurate image annotation is required to train DNNs for accurate image
segmentation. In this study, however, we find that DNNs trained by label images
in which nearly half (49%) of the binary pixel labels are randomly flipped
provide largely the same segmentation performance. This suggests that DNNs
learn high-level structures rather than pixel-level labels per se to segment
fluorescence microscopy images. We refer to these structures as
meta-structures. In support of the existence of the meta-structures, when DNNs
are trained by a series of label images with progressively less meta-structure
information, we find progressive degradation in their segmentation performance.
Motivated by the learning behavior of DNNs trained by random labels and the
characteristics of meta-structures, we propose an unsupervised segmentation
model. Experiments show that it achieves remarkably competitive performance in
comparison to supervised segmentation models."

inherent to human bias. To address this problem, unsupervised techniques have
been proposed in the literature yet it is still an open problem due to the
difficulty of learning any transformation pattern. In this work, we present a
novel optimisation model framed into a new CNN-based contrastive registration

approach is to exploit image-level registration and feature-level from a
contrastive learning mechanism, to perform registration-based segmentation.
Firstly, we propose an architecture to capture the image-to-image

segmentation. Secondly, we embed a contrastive learning mechanism into the
registration architecture to enhance the discriminating capacity of the network
in the feature-level. We show that our proposed technique mitigates the major

the segmentation of synthesised images in different styles should be
consistent. Specifically, our model consists of an image translation module and
a domain-specific segmentation module. The image translation module is a
standard CycleGAN, while the segmentation module contains two domain-specific
segmentation networks. The intra-modality semantic consistency (IMSC) forces
the reconstructed image after a cycle to be segmented in the same way as the
original input image, while the cross-modality semantic consistency (CMSC)
encourages the synthesized images after translation to be segmented exactly the
same as before translation. Comprehensive experimental results on
cross-modality hip joint bone segmentation show the effectiveness of our
proposed method, which achieves an average DICE of 81.61% on the acetabulum and
88.16% on the proximal femur, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. It
is worth to note that without UDA, a model trained on CT for hip joint bone

which drives progress in medical image segmentation. However, those attention
mechanism methods have weakly non-local receptive fields' strengthened
connection for small objects in medical images. Then, the features of important
small objects in abstract or coarse feature maps may be deserted, which leads
to unsatisfactory performance. Moreover, the existing multi-scale methods only
simply focus on different sizes of view, whose sparse multi-scale features
collected are not abundant enough for small objects segmentation. In this work,
a multi-dimensional attention segmentation model with cascade multi-scale

medical images. As the weight function, multi-dimensional attention modules
provide coefficient modification for significant/informative small objects

must overcome inherent anatomical misregistrations and disparities in signal

anatomical factors from the different inputs are jointly processed and fused to
extract more accurate segmentation masks. Image misregistrations are corrected
with a Spatial Transformer Network, which non-linearly aligns the anatomical
factors. The imaging factor captures signal intensity characteristics across
different modality data and is used for image reconstruction, enabling
semi-supervised learning. Temporal and slice pairing between inputs are learned
dynamically. We demonstrate applications in Late Gadolinium Enhanced (LGE) and

samples to be strongly-annotated can be selected randomly or with an active

performance. In this work, we propose a sample selection approach to decide
which samples to annotate for semi-supervised instance segmentation. Our method
consists in first predicting pseudo-masks for the unlabeled pool of samples,
together with a score predicting the quality of the mask. This score is an
estimate of the Intersection Over Union (IoU) of the segment with the ground

score, and show how our approach outperforms a random selection, leading to
improved performance for semi-supervised instance segmentation with low

segmentation and modeling. With segmentation results, a 3D surface mesh and a
corresponding point cloud of the segmented cardiac volume can be reconstructed
for further analyses. Although state-of-the-art methods (e.g., U-Net) have

the predicted 3D point cloud. Extensive experimental results show that by
incorporating a shape prior from the point cloud, the segmentation masks are
more accurate than the state-of-the-art U-Net results in terms of Dice's

remarkably degrades the segmentation performance. To address these two issues,
we present a contextual PolSAR image semantic segmentation method in this

three-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT) technique is employed to
extract discriminative multi-scale features that are robust to speckle noise.
Then Markov random field (MRF) is further applied to enforce label smoothness

demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive

in classifying limited categories in international vision challenges, the image
segmentation accuracies achieved by deep learning in the same challenges are

the quality of a prediction correlates with the model's uncertainty.
Additionally, we demonstrate that a multiple linear regression using the

quality of a prediction (\(R^2=0.718\)). Within the uncertainty-based
human-in-the-loop system, the multiple regression aims at identifying failed

these failed predictions manually. A simulation study demonstrates that the

reliable results in adverse weather conditions is to use video-segmentation
approaches instead of commonly used single-image segmentation methods.
Video-segmentation approaches capture temporal information of the previous
video-frames in addition to current image information, and hence, they are more
robust against disturbances, especially if they occur in only a few frames of
the video-sequence. However, video-segmentation approaches, which are often
based on recurrent neural networks, cannot be applied in real-time applications
anymore, since their recurrent structures in the network are computational
expensive. For instance, the inference time of the LSTM-ICNet, in which
recurrent units are placed at proper positions in the single-segmentation
approach ICNet, increases up to 61 percent compared to the basic ICNet. Hence,
in this work, the LSTM-ICNet is sped up by modifying the recurrent units of the
network so that it becomes real-time capable again. Experiments on different
datasets and various weather conditions show that the inference time can be
decreased by about 23 percent by these modifications, while they achieve
similar performance than the LSTM-ICNet and outperform the single-segmentation
approach enormously in adverse weather conditions."

deal with 3D segmentation for medical image analysis. Existing approaches
either applied multi-view planar (2D) networks or directly used volumetric (3D)
networks for this purpose, but both of them are not ideal: 2D networks cannot
capture 3D contexts effectively, and 3D networks are both memory-consuming and
less stable arguably due to the lack of pre-trained models.
  In this paper, we bridge the gap between 2D and 3D using a novel approach
named Elastic Boundary Projection (EBP). The key observation is that, although
the object is a 3D volume, what we really need in segmentation is to find its
boundary which is a 2D surface. Therefore, we place a number of pivot points in
the 3D space, and for each pivot, we determine its distance to the object
boundary along a dense set of directions. This creates an elastic shell around
each pivot which is initialized as a perfect sphere. We train a 2D deep network
to determine whether each ending point falls within the object, and gradually
adjust the shell so that it gradually converges to the actual shape of the
boundary and thus achieves the goal of segmentation. EBP allows boundary-based
segmentation without cutting a 3D volume into slices or patches, which stands
out from conventional 2D and 3D approaches. EBP achieves promising accuracy in
abdominal organ segmentation. Our code has been open-sourced

applications. In this paper, we propose a fast image segmentation method based
on a novel super boundary-to-pixel direction (super-BPD) and a customized
segmentation algorithm with super-BPD. Precisely, we define BPD on each pixel
as a two-dimensional unit vector pointing from its nearest boundary to the
pixel. In the BPD, nearby pixels from different regions have opposite
directions departing from each other, and adjacent pixels in the same region
have directions pointing to the other or each other (i.e., around medial
points). We make use of such property to partition an image into super-BPDs,
which are novel informative superpixels with robust direction similarity for
fast grouping into segmentation regions. Extensive experimental results on
BSDS500 and Pascal Context demonstrate the accuracy and efficency of the
proposed super-BPD in segmenting images. In practice, the proposed super-BPD
achieves comparable or superior performance with MCG while running at ~25fps
vs. 0.07fps. Super-BPD also exhibits a noteworthy transferability to unseen

computer vision tasks, such as image segmentation and object recognition. Edge
detection is a rather local and simple job, the over-complicated architecture

method inspired framework to produce good edges with minimal complexity. We
simplify the network architecture to include Feature Extractor, Enrichment, and
Summarizer, which roughly correspond to gradient, low pass filter, and pixel

eye fundus images. It is important to design proper techniques to represent
convex shapes. So far, it is still a problem to guarantee that the output
objects from a Deep Neural Convolution Networks (DCNN) are convex shapes. In
this work, we propose a technique which can be easily integrated into the
commonly used DCNNs for image segmentation and guarantee that outputs are
convex shapes. This method is flexible and it can handle multiple objects and
allow some of the objects to be convex. Our method is based on the dual
representation of the sigmoid activation function in DCNNs. In the dual space,
the convex shape prior can be guaranteed by a simple quadratic constraint on a
binary representation of the shapes. Moreover, our method can also integrate
spatial regularization and some other shape prior using a soft thresholding
dynamics (STD) method. The regularization can make the boundary curves of the
segmentation objects to be simultaneously smooth and convex. We design a very
stable active set projection algorithm to numerically solve our model. This
algorithm can form a new plug-and-play DCNN layer called CS-STD whose outputs
must be a nearly binary segmentation of convex objects. In the CS-STD block,
the convexity information can be propagated to guide the DCNN in both forward
and backward propagation during training and prediction process. As an
application example, we apply the convexity prior layer to the retinal fundus
images segmentation by taking the popular DeepLabV3+ as a backbone network.
Experimental results on several public datasets show that our method is
efficient and outperforms the classical DCNN segmentation methods."

Satisfactory visual segments cannot be obtained using FCM. Particle Swarm

semantic segmentation, particularly in medical imaging. Nevertheless, training
high-performing models require large amounts of pixel-level ground truth masks,
which can be prohibitive to obtain in the medical domain. Furthermore, training
such models in a low-data regime highly increases the risk of overfitting.
Recent attempts to alleviate the need for large annotated datasets have
developed training strategies under the few-shot learning paradigm, which
addresses this shortcoming by learning a novel class from only a few labeled
examples. In this context, a segmentation model is trained on episodes, which
represent different segmentation problems, each of them trained with a very
small labeled dataset. In this work, we propose a novel few-shot learning
framework for semantic segmentation, where unlabeled images are also made
available at each episode. To handle this new learning paradigm, we propose to
include surrogate tasks that can leverage very powerful supervisory signals
--derived from the data itself-- for semantic feature learning. We show that
including unlabeled surrogate tasks in the episodic training leads to more
powerful feature representations, which ultimately results in better
generability to unseen tasks. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in
the task of skin lesion segmentation in two publicly available datasets.
Furthermore, our approach is general and model-agnostic, which can be combined

computer vision. In the last decades, researchers developed a large number of
segmentation algorithms for various applications. Amongst these algorithms, the
Normalized cut (Ncut) segmentation method is widely applied due to its good
performance. The Ncut segmentation model is an optimization problem whose
energy is defined on a specifically designed graph. Thus, the segmentation
results of the existing Ncut method are largely dependent on a pre-constructed
similarity measure on the graph since this measure is usually given empirically
by users. This flaw will lead to some undesirable segmentation results. In this
paper, we propose a Ncut-based segmentation algorithm by integrating an
adaptive similarity measure and spatial regularization. The proposed model
combines the Parzen-Rosenblatt window method, non-local weights entropy, Ncut
energy, and regularizer of phase field in a variational framework. Our method
can adaptively update the similarity measure function by estimating some
parameters. This adaptive procedure enables the proposed algorithm finding a
better similarity measure for classification than the Ncut method. We provide
some mathematical interpretation of the proposed adaptive similarity from
multi-viewpoints such as statistics and convex optimization. In addition, the
regularizer of phase field can guarantee that the proposed algorithm has a
robust performance in the presence of noise, and it can also rectify the
similarity measure with a spatial priori. The well-posed theory such as the
existence of the minimizer for the proposed model is given in the paper.

content image forms the structure, the basic geometric lines and shapes of the
resulting image, while the style image sets the color and texture of the
result. The word ""arbitrary"" in this context means the absence of any one
pre-learned style. So, for example, convolutional neural networks capable of
transferring a new style only after training or retraining on a new amount of
data are not con-sidered to solve such a problem, while networks based on the
attention mech-anism that are capable of performing such a transformation
without retraining - yes. An original image can be, for example, a photograph,
and a style image can be a painting of a famous artist. The resulting image in
this case will be the scene depicted in the original photograph, made in the
stylie of this picture. Recent arbitrary style transfer algorithms make it
possible to achieve good re-sults in this task, however, in processing portrait
images of people, the result of such algorithms is either unacceptable due to
excessive distortion of facial features, or weakly expressed, not bearing the
characteristic features of a style image. In this paper, we consider an

extracted multiple times at multiple scales. Second, long-range feature
dependencies are not efficiently modeled, resulting in non-optimal
discriminative feature representations associated with each semantic class. In
this paper we attempt to overcome these limitations with the proposed
architecture, by capturing richer contextual dependencies based on the use of
guided self-attention mechanisms. This approach is able to integrate local
features with their corresponding global dependencies, as well as highlight
interdependent channel maps in an adaptive manner. Further, the additional loss
between different modules guides the attention mechanisms to neglect irrelevant

In many practical applications, it is essential to properly evaluate the
reliability of individual segmentation results. In this study, we propose a
novel framework to provide the statistical significance of segmentation results
in the form of p-values. Specifically, we consider a statistical hypothesis
test for determining the difference between the object and the background
regions. This problem is challenging because the difference can be deceptively
large (called segmentation bias) due to the adaptation of the segmentation
algorithm to the data. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a statistical
approach called selective inference, and develop a framework to compute valid
p-values in which the segmentation bias is properly accounted for. Although the
proposed framework is potentially applicable to various segmentation
algorithms, we focus in this paper on graph cut-based and threshold-based
segmentation algorithms, and develop two specific methods to compute valid
p-values for the segmentation results obtained by these algorithms. We prove
the theoretical validity of these two methods and demonstrate their
practicality by applying them to segmentation problems for medical images."

communication systems (PACS) could provide a possible source of data to train a
CNN for segmentation of organs-at-risk (OARs) in radiotherapy treatment

multi-label segmentation, missing structures in the reference standard do not
have a negative effect on overall segmentation accuracy. These results indicate
that segmentations obtained in a clinical workflow can be used to train an

of segmentation tasks in medical imaging. Convolutional neural networks trained
for image segmentation tasks are usually optimized for (weighted)
cross-entropy. This introduces an adverse discrepancy between the learning
optimization objective (the loss) and the end target metric. Recent works in
computer vision have proposed soft surrogates to alleviate this discrepancy and
directly optimize the desired metric, either through relaxations (soft-Dice,
soft-Jaccard) or submodular optimization (Lov\'asz-softmax). The aim of this
study is two-fold. First, we investigate the theoretical differences in a risk
minimization framework and question the existence of a weighted cross-entropy
loss with weights theoretically optimized to surrogate Dice or Jaccard. Second,
we empirically investigate the behavior of the aforementioned loss functions
w.r.t. evaluation with Dice score and Jaccard index on five medical
segmentation tasks. Through the application of relative approximation bounds,
we show that all surrogates are equivalent up to a multiplicative factor, and
that no optimal weighting of cross-entropy exists to approximate Dice or
Jaccard measures. We validate these findings empirically and show that, while
it is important to opt for one of the target metric surrogates rather than a
cross-entropy-based loss, the choice of the surrogate does not make a
statistical difference on a wide range of medical segmentation tasks."

temporal fully convolutional network based on the U-Net architecture that was
originally proposed for image segmentation. U-Time maps sequential inputs of
arbitrary length to sequences of class labels on a freely chosen temporal

the input signal and aggregating these classifications over fixed intervals to
form the final predictions. We evaluated U-Time for sleep stage classification

architecture for image segmentation, including semantic scene parsing. However,
it is difficult for a generic FCN to discriminate pixels around the object
boundaries, thus FCN based methods may output parsing results with inaccurate
boundaries. Meanwhile, level set based active contours are superior to the
boundary estimation due to the sub-pixel accuracy that they achieve. However,
they are quite sensitive to initial settings. To address these limitations, in
this paper we propose a novel Deep Multiphase Level Set (DMLS) method for
semantic scene parsing, which efficiently incorporates multiphase level sets
into deep neural networks. The proposed method consists of three modules, i.e.,
recurrent FCNs, adaptive multiphase level set, and deeply supervised learning.
More specifically, recurrent FCNs learn multi-level representations of input
images with different contexts. Adaptive multiphase level set drives the
discriminative contour for each semantic class, which makes use of the
advantages of both global and local information. In each time-step of the
recurrent FCNs, deeply supervised learning is incorporated for model training.
Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks have shown that our proposed
method achieves new state-of-the-art performances."

complicated deformation. Facilitated by the rapid progress of deep learning,
learning-based approaches such as VoxelMorph have been emerging for image

registration framework, called NeurReg, with a hybrid loss of displacement
fields and data similarity, which substantially improves the current
state-of-the-art of registrations. Within the framework, we simulate various
transformations by a registration simulator which generates fixed image and
displacement field ground truth for training. Furthermore, we design three
segmentation frameworks based on the proposed registration framework: 1)
atlas-based segmentation, 2) joint learning of both segmentation and
registration tasks, and 3) multi-task learning with atlas-based segmentation as
an intermediate feature. Extensive experimental results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed NeurReg framework based on various metrics: the
endpoint error (EPE) of the predicted displacement field, mean square error

segmentation methods is the lack of generalizability. Manually traced training
images are typically required when segmenting organs in a new imaging modality

manually traced images in one imaging modality (e.g., MRI) are able to train a
segmentation network for another imaging modality (e.g., CT). In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end synthetic segmentation network (SynSeg-Net) to train a

source and target modalities, and (2) manual labels only from source modality.
SynSeg-Net is enabled by the recent advances of cycle generative adversarial

two experiments: (1) MRI to CT splenomegaly synthetic segmentation for
abdominal images, and (2) CT to MRI total intracranial volume synthetic

obtaining paired training data in sufficient quantities is often very costly
and cumbersome. Therefore solutions that employ unpaired data, while less

between supervised and unsupervised I2I translation, with application to
semantic image segmentation. We build upon pix2pix and CycleGAN,
state-of-the-art seminal I2I translation techniques. We propose a method to
select (very few) paired training samples and achieve significant improvements
in both supervised and unsupervised I2I translation settings over random
selection. Further, we boost the performance by incorporating both (selected)
paired and unpaired samples in the training process. Our experiments show that
an extremely weak supervised I2I translation solution using only one paired

segmentation masks without labels. Unfortunately, these algorithms are usually
computationally expensive and often have limitation in semantic segmentation.
In this paper, we propose a novel loss function based on Mumford-Shah
functional that can be used in deep-learning based image segmentation without

the softmax layer of deep neural networks has striking similarity to the
characteristic function in the Mumford-Shah functional. We show that the new

segmentation. Video segmentation is less explored, despite the temporal
dimension being highly informative. Semantic labels, e.g. that cannot be
accurately detected in the current frame, may be inferred by incorporating
information from previous frames. However, video segmentation is challenging
due to the amount of data that needs to be processed and, more importantly, the
cost involved in obtaining ground truth annotations for each frame. In this
paper, we tackle the issue of label scarcity by using consecutive frames of a
video, where only one frame is annotated. We propose a deep, end-to-end
trainable model which leverages temporal information in order to make use of
easy to acquire unlabeled data. Our network architecture relies on a novel
interconnection of two components: a fully convolutional network to model
spatial information and temporal units that are employed at intermediate levels
of the convolutional network in order to propagate information through time.
The main contribution of this work is the guidance of the temporal signal
through the network. We show that only placing a temporal module between the
encoder and decoder is suboptimal (baseline). Our extensive experiments on the
CityScapes dataset indicate that the resulting model can leverage unlabeled
temporal frames and significantly outperform both the frame-by-frame image

often use segmantic segmentations as an invariant scene representation, as the
semantic meaning of each scene part should not be affected by seasonal and
other changes. However, these representations are typically not very

networks with an additional task of boundary prediction and increasing the
weights of boundary pixels' predictions in the loss function. Such strategies
require defining what to attend beforehand and incorporating this defined
attention to the learning model. However, there may exist other groups of
hard-to-learn pixels and manually defining and incorporating the appropriate
attention for each group may not be feasible. In order to provide a more
attainable and scalable solution, this paper proposes AttentionBoost, which is
a new multi-attention learning model based on adaptive boosting. AttentionBoost
designs a multi-stage network and introduces a new loss adjustment mechanism
for a dense prediction model to adaptively learn what to attend at each stage
directly on image data without necessitating any prior definition about what to
attend. This mechanism modulates the attention of each stage to correct the
mistakes of previous stages, by adjusting the loss weight of each pixel
prediction separately with respect to how accurate the previous stages are on
this pixel. This mechanism enables AttentionBoost to learn different attentions
for different pixels at the same stage, according to difficulty of learning
these pixels, as well as multiple attentions for the same pixel at different
stages, according to confidence of these stages on their predictions for this
pixel. Using gland segmentation as a showcase application, our experiments
demonstrate that AttentionBoost improves the results of its counterparts."

techniques. This paper approaches these various deep learning techniques of
image segmentation from an analytical perspective. The main goal of this work
is to provide an intuitive understanding of the major techniques that has made
significant contribution to the image segmentation domain. Starting from some
of the traditional image segmentation approaches, the paper progresses
describing the effect deep learning had on the image segmentation domain.
Thereafter, most of the major segmentation algorithms have been logically
categorized with paragraphs dedicated to their unique contribution. With an
ample amount of intuitive explanations, the reader is expected to have an
improved ability to visualize the internal dynamics of these processes."

for image segmentation has attracted great attention recently. In order to
segment the image into meaningful connected components, this paper proposes an
image segmentation general framework using complex networks based community
detection algorithms. If we consider regions as communities, using community
detection algorithms directly can lead to an over-segmented image. To address
this problem, we start by splitting the image into small regions using an
initial segmentation. The obtained regions are used for building the complex
network. To produce meaningful connected components and detect homogeneous
communities, some combinations of color and texture based features are employed
in order to quantify the regions similarities. To sum up, the network of
regions is constructed adaptively to avoid many small regions in the image, and
then, community detection algorithms are applied on the resulting adaptive
similarity matrix to obtain the final segmented image. Experiments are
conducted on Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and four of the most influential
community detection algorithms are tested. Experimental results have shown that
the proposed general framework increases the segmentation performances compared
to some existing methods."

distance measures between the generated image and its corresponding ground
truth. Despite its ability to produce visually good images, using pixel-based
or even perceptual metrics do not guarantee, in general, that the produced
image is fit for being used as input for low-level computer vision tasks such
as segmentation. To overcome this weakness, we are proposing a novel end-to-end
approach for image dehazing, fit for being used as input to an image
segmentation procedure, while maintaining the visual quality of the generated
images. Inspired by the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), we
propose to optimize the generator by introducing a discriminator network and a
loss function that evaluates segmentation quality of dehazed images. In
addition, we make use of a supplementary loss function that verifies that the
visual and the perceptual quality of the generated image are preserved in hazy
conditions. Results obtained using the proposed technique are appealing, with a
favorable comparison to state-of-the-art approaches when considering the
performance of segmentation algorithms on the hazy images."

appropriate training, a requirement that is difficult to satisfy in the medical
field. This issue can usually be avoided with a proper initialization of the
weights. On the task of medical image segmentation in general, two techniques
are oftentimes employed to tackle the training of a deep network $f_T$. The
first one consists in reusing some weights of a network $f_S$ pre-trained on a
large scale database ($e.g.$ ImageNet). This procedure, also known as
$transfer$ $learning$, happens to reduce the flexibility when it comes to new
network design since $f_T$ is constrained to match some parts of $f_S$. The
second commonly used technique consists in working on image patches to benefit
from the large number of available patches. This paper brings together these
two techniques and propose to train $arbitrarily$ $designed$ $networks$ that
segment an image in one forward pass, with a focus on relatively small
databases. An experimental work have been carried out on the tasks of retinal
blood vessel segmentation and the optic disc one, using four publicly available
databases. Furthermore, three types of network are considered, going from a
very light weighted network to a densely connected one. The final results show
the efficiency of the proposed framework along with state of the art results on
all the databases."

training and evaluating automated segmentation of skin lesions. We explore what
different degrees of agreement represent, and how they affect different use
cases for segmentation. We also evaluate how conditioning the ground truths
using different (but very simple) algorithms may help to enhance agreement and
may be appropriate for some use cases. The segmentation of skin lesions is a
cornerstone task for automated skin lesion analysis, useful both as an
end-result to locate/detect the lesions and as an ancillary task for lesion
classification. Lesion segmentation, however, is a very challenging task, due
not only to the challenge of image segmentation itself but also to the
difficulty in obtaining properly annotated data. Detecting accurately the
borders of lesions is challenging even for trained humans, since, for many
lesions, those borders are fuzzy and ill-defined. Using lesions and annotations
from the ISIC Archive, we estimate inter-annotator agreement for skin-lesion
segmentation and propose several simple procedures that may help to improve
inter-annotator agreement if used to condition the ground truths."

including semantic segmentation becomes an increasingly popular task in
computer vision today. Convolutional neural networks are powerful visual models
that yield hierarchies of features and practitioners widely use them to process
remote sensing data. When performing remote sensing image segmentation,
multiple instances of one class with precisely defined boundaries are often the
case, and it is crucial to extract those boundaries accurately. The accuracy of
segments boundaries delineation influences the quality of the whole segmented
areas explicitly. However, widely-used segmentation loss functions such as BCE,
IoU loss or Dice loss do not penalize misalignment of boundaries sufficiently.
In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, namely a differentiable
surrogate of a metric accounting accuracy of boundary detection. We can use the
loss function with any neural network for binary segmentation. We performed
validation of our loss function with various modifications of UNet on a
synthetic dataset, as well as using real-world data (ISPRS Potsdam, INRIA AIL).
Trained with the proposed loss function, models outperform baseline methods in

applied in various real-world applications. They can learn the model adaptively

good machine learning system is composed of plentiful training data, a good
model training process, and an accurate inference. Many factors can affect the
performance of the machine learning process, among which the diversity of the
machine learning process is an important one. The diversity can help each
procedure to guarantee a total good machine learning: diversity of the training
data ensures that the training data can provide more discriminative information
for the model, diversity of the learned model (diversity in parameters of each
model or diversity among different base models) makes each parameter/model
capture unique or complement information and the diversity in inference can
provide multiple choices each of which corresponds to a specific plausible
local optimal result. Even though the diversity plays an important role in
machine learning process, there is no systematical analysis of the
diversification in machine learning system. In this paper, we systematically
summarize the methods to make data diversification, model diversification, and
inference diversification in the machine learning process, respectively. In
addition, the typical applications where the diversity technology improved the
machine learning performance have been surveyed, including the remote sensing
imaging tasks, machine translation, camera relocalization, image segmentation,
object detection, topic modeling, and others. Finally, we discuss some
challenges of the diversity technology in machine learning and point out some

image segmentation, and hence, video sequences are currently segmented by
processing each frame of the video sequence separately. The disadvantage of
this is that temporal image information is not considered, which improves the
performance of the segmentation approach. One possibility to include temporal
information is to use recurrent neural networks. However, there are only a few
approaches using recurrent networks for video segmentation so far. These
approaches extend the encoder-decoder network architecture of well-known
segmentation approaches and place convolutional LSTM layers between encoder and
decoder. However, in this paper it is shown that this position is not optimal,
and that other positions in the network exhibit better performance. Nowadays,
state-of-the-art segmentation approaches rarely use the classical
encoder-decoder structure, but use multi-branch architectures. These
architectures are more complex, and hence, it is more difficult to place the
recurrent units at a proper position. In this work, the multi-branch
architectures are extended by convolutional LSTM layers at different positions
and evaluated on two different datasets in order to find the best one. It
turned out that the proposed approach outperforms the pure CNN-based approach
for up to 1.6 percent."

method, called Adaptive-Weighting-Multi-Field-of-View-CNN (AWMF-CNN), that can
adaptively use image features from images with different magnifications to
segment multiple cancer subtype regions in the input image. The proposed method
aggregates several expert CNNs for images of different magnifications by
adaptively changing the weight of each expert depending on the input image. It
leverages information in the images with different magnifications that might be
useful for identifying the subtypes. It outperformed other state-of-the-art

high computation complexities of various deep neural network (DNN) based
frameworks and the increasingly large volume of medical images that need to be
processed. It has been demonstrated that for medical images the transmission
from local to clouds is much more expensive than the computation in the clouds
itself. Towards this, 3D image compression techniques have been widely applied
to reduce the data traffic. However, most of the existing image compression
techniques are developed around human vision, i.e., they are designed to
minimize distortions that can be perceived by human eyes. In this paper we will
use deep learning based medical image segmentation as a vehicle and demonstrate
that interestingly, machine and human view the compression quality differently.
Medical images compressed with good quality w.r.t. human vision may result in
inferior segmentation accuracy. We then design a machine vision oriented 3D
image compression framework tailored for segmentation using DNNs. Our method
automatically extracts and retains image features that are most important to
the segmentation. Comprehensive experiments on widely adopted segmentation
frameworks with HVSMR 2016 challenge dataset show that our method can achieve
significantly higher segmentation accuracy at the same compression rate, or
much better compression rate under the same segmentation accuracy, when
compared with the existing JPEG 2000 method. To the best of the authors'

magnetic resonance (MR) images of a human head with abnormal brain anatomy.
Such images produce problems for automatic brain segmentation algorithms, and
as a result, poor perfusion ROI detection affects both quantitative
measurements and visual assessment of perfusion data. In the proposed approach
image segmentation is based on CUSUM filter usage that was adapted to be
applicable to process DSC perfusion MR images. The result of segmentation is a
binary mask of brain ROI that is generated via usage of brain boundary
location. Each point of the boundary between the brain and surrounding tissues
is detected as a change-point by CUSUM filter. Proposed adopted CUSUM filter
operates by accumulating the deviations between the observed and expected
intensities of image points at the time of moving on a trajectory. Motion
trajectory is created by the iterative change of movement direction inside the
background region in order to reach brain region, and vice versa after boundary
crossing. Proposed segmentation approach was evaluated with Dice index
comparing obtained results to the reference standard. Manually marked brain
region pixels (reference standard), as well as visual inspection of detected

The results showed that proposed approach is suitable to be used for brain ROI

adequate model in cases with significant nonlinear shape variation or where the
prior distribution is multimodal. Nonparametric density estimation is more
general, but has a ravenous appetite for training samples and poses serious
challenges in optimization, especially in high dimensional spaces. Here, we
propose a maximum-a-posteriori formulation that relies on a generative image
model by incorporating both local intensity and global shape priors. We use
deep autoencoders to capture the complex intensity distribution while avoiding
the careful selection of hand-crafted features. We formulate the shape prior as
a mixture of Gaussians and learn the corresponding parameters in a
high-dimensional shape space rather than pre-projecting onto a low-dimensional
subspace. In segmentation, we treat the identity of the mixture component as a
latent variable and marginalize it within a generalized
expectation-maximization framework. We present a conditional maximization-based
scheme that alternates between a closed-form solution for component-specific
shape parameters that provides a global update-based optimization strategy, and
an intensity-based energy minimization that translates the global notion of a
nonlinear shape prior into a set of local penalties. We demonstrate our
approach on the left atrial segmentation from gadolinium-enhanced MRI, which is
useful in quantifying the atrial geometry in patients with atrial fibrillation."

dense connections occur not only between the pairs of layers within the same
path, but also between those across different paths. This contrasts with the
existing multi-modal CNN approaches, in which modeling several modalities
relies entirely on a single joint layer (or level of abstraction) for fusion,
typically either at the input or at the output of the network. Therefore, the
proposed network has total freedom to learn more complex combinations between
the modalities, within and in-between all the levels of abstraction, which
increases significantly the learning representation. We report extensive

semantic image segmentation to discriminate which regions of the scene require
simplification and which should be kept at high level of details. We propose
four different point cloud simplification methods which decimate the perceived
point cloud by relying on class-specific local and global statistics still
maintaining more points in the proximity of class boundaries to preserve the
infra-class edges and discontinuities. 3D dense model is obtained by fusing the

segment a new image, the feature vectors are computed and clustered. Both
empirically and theoretically, it is unclear whether or when deep metric
learning is superior to the more conventional approach of directly predicting
an affinity graph with a convolutional net. We compare the two approaches using
brain images from serial section electron microscopy images, which constitute
an especially challenging example of instance segmentation. We first show that
seed-based postprocessing of the feature vectors, as originally proposed,
produces inferior accuracy because it is difficult for the convolutional net to
predict feature vectors that remain uniform across large objects. Then we
consider postprocessing by thresholding a nearest neighbor graph followed by
connected components. In this case, segmentations from a ""metric graph"" turn
out to be competitive or even superior to segmentations from a directly
predicted affinity graph. To explain these findings theoretically, we invoke
the property that the metric function satisfies the triangle inequality. Then
we show with an example where this constraint suppresses noise, causing
connected components to more robustly segment a metric graph than an
unconstrained affinity graph."

segmentation using fully convolutional networks (FCNs). Most of these networks
employ encoder-decoder style architecture similar to U-Net and are trained with
images and the corresponding segmentation maps as a pixel-wise classification
task. Such frameworks only exploit class information by using the ground truth
segmentation maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning framework
with the main aim of exploiting structural and spatial information along with
the class information. We modify the decoder part of the FCN to exploit class
information and the structural information as well. We intend to do this while
also keeping the parameters of the network as low as possible. We obtain the
structural information using either of the two ways: i) using the contour map
and ii) using the distance map, both of which can be obtained from ground truth
segmentation maps with no additional annotation costs. We also explore
different ways in which distance maps can be computed and study the effects of
different distance maps on the segmentation performance. We also experiment
extensively on two different medical image segmentation applications: i.e i)
using color fundus images for optic disc and cup segmentation and ii) using
endoscopic images for polyp segmentation. Through our experiments, we report
results comparable to, and in some cases performing better than the current
state-of-the-art architectures and with an order of 2x reduction in the number
of parameters."

Encoder-Decoder architectures, and propose a new universal decoder, called
cascade decoder, to improve semantic segmentation accuracy. Our cascade decoder
can be embedded into existing networks and trained altogether in an end-to-end
fashion. The cascade decoder structure aims to conduct more effective decoding
of hierarchically encoded features and is more compatible with common encoders
than the known decoders. We replace the decoders of state-of-the-art models
with our cascade decoder for several challenging biomedical image segmentation
tasks, and the considerable improvements achieved demonstrate the efficacy of
our new decoding method."

performance in many different 2D medical image analysis tasks. In clinical
practice, however, a large part of the medical imaging data available is in 3D.
This has motivated the development of 3D CNNs for volumetric image segmentation
in order to benefit from more spatial context. Due to GPU memory restrictions
caused by moving to fully 3D, state-of-the-art methods depend on
subvolume/patch processing and the size of the input patch is usually small,
limiting the incorporation of larger context information for a better
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Holistic Decomposition
Convolution (HDC), for an effective and efficient semantic segmentation of
volumetric images. HDC consists of a periodic down-shuffling operation followed
by a conventional 3D convolution. HDC has the advantage of significantly
reducing the size of the data for sub-sequential processing while using all the
information available in the input irrespective of the down-shuffling factors.
Results obtained from comprehensive experiments conducted on hip T1 MR images
and intervertebral disc T2 MR images demonstrate the efficacy of the present
approach."

proposal method that actively proposes annotation seeds for the user to label.
The user only needs to check which ones of the query seeds are inside the
region of interest (ROI). We enforce the sparsity and diversity criteria on the
selection of the query seeds. At each round of interaction the user is only
presented with a small number of informative query seeds that are far apart
from each other. As a result, we are able to derive a user friendly interaction
mechanism for annotation on small touchscreen devices. The user merely has to
swipe through on the ROI-relevant query seeds, which should be easy since those
gestures are commonly used on a touchscreen. The performance of our algorithm
is evaluated on six publicly available datasets. The evaluation results show
that our algorithm achieves high segmentation accuracy, with short response

image processing. The corresponding matrix inherits the complex structure of
the underlying network and is in certain applications densely populated. This
makes computations, in particular matrix-vector products, with the graph
Laplacian a hard task. A typical application is the computation of a number of
its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Standard methods become infeasible as the
number of nodes in the graph is too large. We propose the use of the fast
summation based on the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT) to perform
the dense matrix-vector product with the graph Laplacian fast without ever
forming the whole matrix. The enormous flexibility of the NFFT algorithm allows
us to embed the accelerated multiplication into Lanczos-based eigenvalues
routines or iterative linear system solvers and even consider other than the
standard Gaussian kernels. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach on a
number of test problems from image segmentation to semi-supervised learning

fully convolutional deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose new deep
learning strategies for DenseNets to improve segmenting images with subtle
differences in intensity values and features. We aim to segment brain tissue on
infant brain MRI at about 6 months of age where white matter and gray matter of
the developing brain show similar T1 and T2 relaxation times, thus appear to
have similar intensity values on both T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans. Brain
tissue segmentation at this age is, therefore, very challenging. To this end,
we propose an exclusive multi-label training strategy to segment the mutually
exclusive brain tissues with similarity loss functions that automatically
balance the training based on class prevalence. Using our proposed training
strategy based on similarity loss functions and patch prediction fusion we
decrease the number of parameters in the network, reduce the complexity of the
training process focusing the attention on less number of tasks, while
mitigating the effects of data imbalance between labels and inaccuracies near
patch borders. By taking advantage of these strategies we were able to perform
fast image segmentation (90 seconds per 3D volume), using a network with less
parameters than many state-of-the-art networks, overcoming issues such as
3Dvs2D training and large vs small patch size selection, while achieving the
top performance in segmenting brain tissue among all methods tested in first

strategy improves the training process through balanced training and by
reducing its complexity while providing a trained model that works for any size

peritumoral edema, necrotic core, enhancing and non-enhancing tumor core from
multimodal MRI scans has important clinical relevance in diagnosis, prognosis
and treatment of brain tumors. However, due to the highly heterogeneous
appearance and shape, segmentation of the sub-regions is very challenging.
Recent development using deep learning models has proved its effectiveness in
the past several brain segmentation challenges as well as other semantic and
medical image segmentation problems. Most models in brain tumor segmentation
use a 2D/3D patch to predict the class label for the center voxel and variant
patch sizes and scales are used to improve the model performance. However, it
has low computation efficiency and also has limited receptive field. U-Net is a
widely used network structure for end-to-end segmentation and can be used on
the entire image or extracted patches to provide classification labels over the
entire input voxels so that it is more efficient and expect to yield better
performance with larger input size. Furthermore, instead of picking the best
network structure, an ensemble of multiple models, trained on different dataset
or different hyper-parameters, can generally improve the segmentation
performance. In this study we propose to use an ensemble of 3D U-Nets with
different hyper-parameters for brain tumor segmentation. Preliminary results
showed effectiveness of this model. In addition, we developed a linear model
for survival prediction using extracted imaging and non-imaging features,
which, despite the simplicity, can effectively reduce overfitting and
regression errors."

localization are cast into a single optimization problem that integrates
information from low level appearance cues with that of high level localization
cues in a very weakly supervised manner. The proposed framework leverages two
representations at different levels, exploits the spatial relationship between
bounding boxes and superpixels as linear constraints and simultaneously
discriminates between foreground and background at bounding box and superpixel
level. Different from previous approaches that mainly rely on discriminative
clustering, we incorporate a foreground model that minimizes the histogram
difference of an object across all image frames. Exploiting the geometric
relation between the superpixels and bounding boxes enables the transfer of
segmentation cues to improve localization output and vice-versa. Inclusion of
the foreground model generalizes our discriminative framework to video data
where the background tends to be similar and thus, not discriminative. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified framework on the YouTube Object

due to their heterogeneous and diffusive shapes. Recently, 2D and 3D deep
convolutional neural networks have become popular in medical image segmentation
tasks because of the utilization of large labeled datasets to learn
hierarchical features. However, 3D networks have some drawbacks due to their
high cost on computational resources. In this paper, we propose a 3D hybrid
residual attention-aware segmentation method, named RA-UNet, to precisely
extract the liver volume of interests (VOI) and segment tumors from the liver
VOI. The proposed network has a basic architecture as a 3D U-Net which extracts
contextual information combining low-level feature maps with high-level ones.
Attention modules are stacked so that the attention-aware features change
adaptively as the network goes ""very deep"" and this is made possible by
residual learning. This is the first work that an attention residual mechanism
is used to process medical volumetric images. We evaluated our framework on the
public MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation dataset and the 3DIRCADb dataset.
The results show that our architecture outperforms other state-of-the-art

achieves good performance on a brain tumor segmentation task as well."

image analysis, with applications such as longitudinal studies, population
modeling, and atlas based image segmentation. Registration is often phrased as
an optimization problem, i.e., finding a deformation field that is optimal
according to a given objective function. Discrete, combinatorial, optimization
techniques have successfully been employed to solve the resulting optimization
problem. Specifically, optimization based on $\alpha$-expansion with minimal
graph cuts has been proposed as a powerful tool for image registration. The
high computational cost of the graph-cut based optimization approach, however,
limits the utility of this approach for registration of large volume images.
Methods: Here, we propose to accelerate graph-cut based deformable registration
by dividing the image into overlapping sub-regions and restricting the
$\alpha$-expansion moves to a single sub-region at a time. Results: We
demonstrate empirically that this approach can achieve a large reduction in
computation time -- from days to minutes -- with only a small penalty in terms
of solution quality. Conclusion: The reduction in computation time provided by
the proposed method makes graph cut based deformable registration viable for
large volume images. Significance: Graph cut based image registration has
previously been shown to produce excellent results, but the high computational
cost has hindered the adoption of the method for registration of large medical
volume images. Our proposed method lifts this restriction, requiring only a
small fraction of the computational cost to produce results of comparable
quality."

novel multispecies biophysical tumor growth model with a generative adversarial
model to create realistic looking synthetic multimodal MR images with known

to enrich available segmentation data by computing the segmentation for healthy

registration between the BraTS training data and a set of prelabeled atlases,
provides more information for training and reduces the class imbalance problem.
Our overall approach is not specific to any particular neural network and can
be used in conjunction with existing solutions. We demonstrate the performance

predicts the foreground at a reduced resolution, and a multi-scale refining
network (MSRN) that refines the foreground at full resolution. The TSLFN
includes two distinct deep streams followed by a fusion network. The intuition
is that, since user interactions are more direct information on
foreground/background than the image itself, the two-stream structure of the
TSLFN reduces the number of layers between the pure user interaction features
and the network output, allowing the user interactions to have a more direct
impact on the segmentation result. The MSRN fuses the features from different
layers of TSLFN with different scales, in order to seek the local to global
information on the foreground to refine the segmentation result at full
resolution. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets.

highly unbalanced object sizes especially in 3D segmentation. In this paper, we
propose a network architecture and the corresponding loss function which
improve segmentation of very small structures. By combining skip connections

segmentation, we propose a fast converging and computationally efficient
network architecture for accurate segmentation. Furthermore, inspired by the
concept of focal loss, we propose an exponential logarithmic loss which
balances the labels not only by their relative sizes but also by their
segmentation difficulties. We achieve an average Dice coefficient of 82% on
brain segmentation with 20 labels, with the ratio of the smallest to largest
object sizes as 0.14%. Less than 100 epochs are required to reach such
accuracy, and segmenting a 128x128x128 volume only takes around 0.4 s."

functional. We normalize the data and perimeter terms in the functional to
expedite the graph cut without having to optimize the scaling parameter
$\lambda$. In place of a training process, predetermined tissue means are
computed based on sample regions identified by expert radiologists. The
proposed method also has the advantage of being relatively simple to implement
computationally. It was evaluated against the ground truth on a clinical CT

  First, we manage to show that after simple preprocessing, such images offer

Correct genuine match rate of over 99.5% was achieved using one of the

labels, ranging from tens to a few hundreds. With a large number of labels,
training and evaluation of such task become extremely challenging due to
correlation between labels and lack of datasets with complete annotations. We
formulate semantic segmentation as a problem of image segmentation given a
semantic concept, and propose a novel system which can potentially handle an
unlimited number of concepts, including objects, parts, stuff, and attributes.
We achieve this using a weakly and semi-supervised framework leveraging
multiple datasets with different levels of supervision. We first train a deep
neural network on a 6M stock image dataset with only image-level labels to
learn visual-semantic embedding on 18K concepts. Then, we refine and extend the
embedding network to predict an attention map, using a curated dataset with
bounding box annotations on 750 concepts. Finally, we train an attention-driven
class agnostic segmentation network using an 80-category fully annotated
dataset. We perform extensive experiments to validate that the proposed system
performs competitively to the state of the art on fully supervised concepts,
and is capable of producing accurate segmentations for weakly learned and
unseen concepts."

Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Routine
interventions to improve symptom severity in movement disorders, for example,
often consist of surgery or deep brain stimulation to diencephalic nuclei.
Therefore, accurate delineation of grey matter thalamic subregions is of the
upmost clinical importance. MRI is highly appropriate for structural
segmentation as it provides different views of the anatomy from a single
scanning session. Though with several contrasts potentially available, it is
also of increasing importance to develop new image segmentation techniques that
can operate multi-spectrally. We hereby propose a new segmentation method for
use with multi-modality data, which we evaluated for automated segmentation of
major thalamic subnuclear groups using T1-, T2*-weighted and quantitative
susceptibility mapping (QSM) information. The proposed method consists of four
steps: highly iterative image co-registration, manual segmentation on the
average training-data template, supervised learning for pattern recognition,
and a final convex optimisation step imposing further spatial constraints to
refine the solution. This led to solutions in greater agreement with manual
segmentation than the standard Morel atlas based approach. Furthermore, we show
that the multi-contrast approach boosts segmentation performances. We then
investigated whether prior knowledge using the training-template contours could
further improve convex segmentation accuracy and robustness, which led to
highly precise multi-contrast segmentations in single subjects. This approach
can be extended to most 3D imaging data types and any region of interest
discernible in single scans or multi-subject templates."

regularization based on a norm of the function, as is classically considered in
statistical learning theory. In this work, we propose sampling-based
approximations to weighted function norms as regularizers for deep neural
networks. We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first proof in the
literature of the NP-hardness of computing function norms of DNNs, motivating
the necessity of an approximate approach. We then derive a generalization bound
for functions trained with weighted norms and prove that a natural stochastic
optimization strategy minimizes the bound. Finally, we empirically validate the
improved performance of the proposed regularization strategies for both convex

assesses left ventricle function and myocardial perfusion for the detection of
coronary artery diseases. Automatic MCE perfusion quantification is challenging
and requires accurate segmentation of the myocardium from noisy and
time-varying images. Random forests (RF) have been successfully applied to many
medical image segmentation tasks. However, the pixel-wise RF classifier ignores
contextual relationships between label outputs of individual pixels. RF which
only utilizes local appearance features is also susceptible to data suffering
from large intensity variations. In this paper, we demonstrate how to overcome
the above limitations of classic RF by presenting a fully automatic
segmentation pipeline for myocardial segmentation in full-cycle 2D MCE data.
Specifically, a statistical shape model is used to provide shape prior
information that guide the RF segmentation in two ways. First, a novel shape
model (SM) feature is incorporated into the RF framework to generate a more
accurate RF probability map. Second, the shape model is fitted to the RF
probability map to refine and constrain the final segmentation to plausible
myocardial shapes. We further improve the performance by introducing a bounding
box detection algorithm as a preprocessing step in the segmentation pipeline.
Our approach on 2D image is further extended to 2D+t sequence which ensures
temporal consistency in the resultant sequence segmentations. When evaluated on
clinical MCE data, our proposed method achieves notable improvement in
segmentation accuracy and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods including
the classic RF and its variants, active shape model and image registration."

in the absence of ground truth is of paramount importance in clinical practice,
but also in large-scale studies to avoid the inclusion of invalid data in
subsequent analysis.
  In this work, we propose two approaches of real-time automated quality
control for cardiovascular MR segmentations using deep learning. First, we
train a neural network on 12,880 samples to predict Dice Similarity
Coefficients (DSC) on a per-case basis. We report a mean average error (MAE) of
0.03 on 1,610 test samples and 97% binary classification accuracy for
separating low and high quality segmentations. Secondly, in the scenario where
no manually annotated data is available, we train a network to predict DSC
scores from estimated quality obtained via a reverse testing strategy. We
report an MAE=0.14 and 91% binary classification accuracy for this case.
Predictions are obtained in real-time which, when combined with real-time
segmentation methods, enables instant feedback on whether an acquired scan is
analysable while the patient is still in the scanner. This further enables new
applications of optimising image acquisition towards best possible analysis
results."

better integrate features from different scales through a coarse-to-fine

In this paper, we present a novel method for interactive medical image
segmentation with the following merits. (1) Our design is fundamentally
different from previous pure patch-based and image-based segmentation methods.
We observe that during delineation, the physician repeatedly check the
inside-outside intensity changing to determine the boundary, which indicates
that comparison in an inside-outside manner is extremely important. Thus, we
innovatively model our segmentation task as learning the representation of the
bi-directional sequential patches, starting from (or ending in) the given
central point of the object. This can be realized by our proposed ConvRNN
network embedded with a gated memory propagation unit. (2) Unlike previous
interactive methods (requiring bounding box or seed points), we only ask the
physician to merely click on the rough central point of the object before
segmentation, which could simultaneously enhance the performance and reduce the
segmentation time. (3) We utilize our method in a multi-level framework for
better performance. We systematically evaluate our method in three different
segmentation tasks including CT kidney tumor, MR prostate, and PROMISE12

conventional k-means to the representations extracted by the centroids and then
project cluster labels to the target images. We evaluated our methods on

very hard samples might have annotation errors, we propose a new sample
selection policy, named Relaxed Upper Confident Bound (RUCB). Compared with
other sample selection policies, e.g., Upper Confident Bound (UCB), it exploits
a range of hard samples rather than being stuck with a small set of very hard
ones, which mitigates the influence of annotation errors during training. We
apply this new sample selection policy to training a multi-organ segmentation

merging and (2) in which order those superpixels must be merged together. In
this perspective, we firstly introduce a robust adaptive multi-scale superpixel
similarity in which region comparisons are made both at content and common
border level. Secondly, we propose a global merging strategy to efficiently
guide the region merging process. Such strategy uses an adpative merging
criterion to ensure that best region aggregations are given highest priorities.
This allows to reach a final segmentation into consistent regions with strong
boundary adherence. We perform experiments on the BSDS500 image dataset to

adjacency relation, and iv) a seed pixel recomputation procedure to generate
improved sets of connected superpixels (supervoxels in 3D) per iteration. The
superpixels in ISF structurally correspond to spanning trees rooted at those

layers. Then we bring out multiple pre-outputs, each pre-output is generated
from an unpooling layer by one-step upsampling. Finally, we concatenate these
pre-outputs to get the final output. As a result, our proposed network makes
highly use of the feature information by fusing and reusing feature maps. In
addition, when training our model, we add multiple soft cost functions on
pre-outputs and final outputs. In this way, we can reduce the loss reduction
when the loss is back propagated. We evaluate our model on three major

most state-of-the-art methods rely on DCNNs as their workhorse. A major reason
for their success is that deep networks learn to accumulate contextual
information over very large windows (receptive fields). However, this success
comes at a cost, since the associated loss of effecive spatial resolution
washes out high-frequency details and leads to blurry object boundaries. Here,
we propose to counter this effect by combining semantic segmentation with
semantically informed edge detection, thus making class-boundaries explicit in
the model, First, we construct a comparatively simple, memory-efficient model

method based on evolutionary computation which is a model inspired from human
behavior. Based on this model, a four layer process for image segmentation is
proposed using the split/merge approach. In the first layer, an image is split
into numerous regions using the watershed algorithm. In the second layer, a
co-evolutionary process is applied to form centers of finals segments by
merging similar primary regions. In the third layer, a meta-heuristic process
uses two operators to connect the residual regions to their corresponding
determined centers. In the final layer, an evolutionary algorithm is used to
combine the resulted similar and neighbor regions. Different layers of the
algorithm are totally independent, therefore for certain applications a
specific layer can be changed without constraint of changing other layers. Some
properties of this algorithm like the flexibility of its method, the ability to
use different feature vectors for segmentation (grayscale, color, texture,
etc), the ability to control uniformity and the number of final segments using
free parameters and also maintaining small regions, makes it possible to apply
the algorithm to different applications. Moreover, the independence of each
region from other regions in the second layer, and the independence of centers
in the third layer, makes parallel implementation possible. As a result the
algorithm speed will increase. The presented algorithm was tested on a standard
dataset (BSDS 300) of images, and the region boundaries were compared with
different people segmentation contours. Results show the efficiency of the
algorithm and its improvement to similar methods. As an instance, in 70% of
tested images, results are better than ACT algorithm, besides in 100% of tested
images, we had better results in comparison with VSP algorithm."

Specifically, the Global Convolutional Network (GCN) was used as the generator
to reduce false negatives, while the Markovian discriminator (PatchGAN) was
used to alleviate false positives. A cohort of clinically acquired 3D MRI scans

regions. Our segmentation method consists of the three steps: generating seed
regions, merging the regions, and applying a pixel-wise boundary determination
algorithm to the resultant polygonal regions. The major features of our method
are as follows: the use of square elemental regions instead of pixels as the
processing unit, a seed generation method based on enhanced gradient values, a
seed region growing method exploiting local gradient values, a region merging
method using a similarity measure including a homogeneity distance based on
Tsallis entropy, and a termination condition of region merging using an
estimated desired number of regions. Using square regions as the processing
unit substantially reduces the time complexity of the algorithm and makes the
performance stable. The experimental results show that our method exhibits
stable performance for a variety of natural images, including heavily textured
areas, and produces good segmentation results using the same parameter values.
The results of our method are fairly comparable to, and in some respects better
than, those of existing algorithms."

increasingly applied in the field of biomedical imaging. One of the challenges
in performing the multimodal analysis is that there exist multiple schemes for
fusing the information from different modalities, where such schemes are
application-dependent and lack a unified framework to guide their designs. In
this work we firstly propose a conceptual architecture for the image fusion
schemes in supervised biomedical image analysis: fusing at the feature level,
fusing at the classifier level, and fusing at the decision-making level.
Further, motivated by the recent success in applying deep learning for natural
image analysis, we implement the three image fusion schemes above based on the
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with varied structures, and combined into a
single framework. The proposed image segmentation framework is capable of
analyzing the multi-modality images using different fusing schemes
simultaneously. The framework is applied to detect the presence of soft tissue
sarcoma from the combination of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed
Tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images. It is found from
the results that while all the fusion schemes outperform the single-modality
schemes, fusing at the feature level can generally achieve the best performance
in terms of both accuracy and computational cost, but also suffers from the
decreased robustness in the presence of large errors in any image modalities."

auto-encoder) or by re-using the layers from another network (transfer
learning). Hence, many training epochs are needed before meaningful weights are
learned, or a rather similar dataset is required for seeding a fine-tuning of
transfer learning. In this paper, we describe how to turn an LDA into either a

importance in many fields of computer vision such as image compression, medical

the constrained platform dimensions and the need for portability, low power
consumption and simultaneously the need for real time image segmentation, we
envision hardware parallelism as the way forward to achieve higher
acceleration. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are among the best suited
for this task as they provide high computing power in a small physical area.
They exceed the computing speed of software based implementations by breaking
the paradigm of sequential execution and accomplishing more per clock cycle
operations by enabling hardware level parallelization at an architectural
level. In this paper, we propose three novel architectures of a well known
Efficient Graph based Image Segmentation algorithm. These proposed

segmentation method to improve the results obtained by an automatic CNN and to
reduce user interactions during refinement for higher accuracy. We use one CNN
to obtain an initial automatic segmentation, on which user interactions are
added to indicate mis-segmentations. Another CNN takes as input the user
interactions with the initial segmentation and gives a refined result. We
propose to combine user interactions with CNNs through geodesic distance
transforms, and propose a resolution-preserving network that gives a better
dense prediction. In addition, we integrate user interactions as hard

In the past decade, multi-atlas la-bel fusion has become a state-of-the-art
segmentation technique for 3D image and many efforts have been made to adapt it
to a 4D longitudinal fashion. However, the previous methods were either limited
by using application specified energy function (e.g., surface fusion and multi
model fusion) or only considered tem-poral smoothness on two consecutive time
points (t and t+1) under sparsity as-sumption. Therefore, a 4D multi-atlas
label fusion theory for general label fusion purpose and simultaneously
considering temporal consistency on all time points is appealing. Herein, we
propose a novel longitudinal label fusion algorithm, called 4D joint label
fusion (4DJLF), to incorporate the temporal consistency modeling via non-local
patch-intensity covariance models. The advantages of 4DJLF include: (1) 4DJLF
is under the general label fusion framework by simul-taneously incorporating
the spatial and temporal covariance on all longitudinal time points. (2) The
proposed algorithm is a longitudinal generalization of a lead-ing joint label
fusion method (JLF) that has proven adaptable to a wide variety of
applications. (3) The spatial temporal consistency of atlases is modeled in a
prob-abilistic model inspired from both voting based and statistical fusion.
The pro-posed approach improves the consistency of the longitudinal
segmentation while retaining sensitivity compared with original JLF approach
using the same set of atlases. The method is available online in open-source."

iterative inference for capturing and exploiting the complex joint distribution

applied to image pixel-wise segmentation, with the estimated conditional score
used to perform gradient ascent towards a mode of the estimated conditional
distribution. This extends previous work on score estimation by denoising
autoencoders to the case of a conditional distribution, with a novel use of a
corrupted feedforward predictor replacing Gaussian corruption. An advantage of
this approach over more classical ways to perform iterative inference for
structured outputs, like conditional random fields (CRFs), is that it is not
any more necessary to define an explicit energy function linking the output
variables. To keep computations tractable, such energy function
parametrizations are typically fairly constrained, involving only a few
neighbors of each of the output variables in each clique. We experimentally
find that the proposed iterative inference from conditional score estimation by
conditional denoising autoencoders performs better than comparable models based
on CRFs or those not using any explicit modeling of the conditional joint
distribution of outputs."

this problem by proposing a novel and effective approach that aims to
dramatically minimize the human intervention needed to train the detection and
classification algorithms. The idea is to procedurally generate large synthetic
training datasets randomizing the key features of the target environment (i.e.,

tuning these model parameters, and exploiting a few real-world textures, it is
possible to render a large amount of realistic views of an artificial
agricultural scenario with no effort. The generated data can be directly used

particular interest. We present a supervised image segmentation method that
incorporates spatial information to locate boundaries between regions with
overlapping intensity histograms. The segmentation of a pixel is determined by
comparing its intensity to distributions from local, nearby pixel intensities.
Because of the statistical nature of the algorithm, we use maximum likelihood

convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown impressive performance and have

benefit that task-specific feature design is no longer necessary. However, a
major downside of deep learning methods is that they are extremely data-hungry,
thus aggravating the perennial bottleneck of supervised classification, to
obtain enough annotated training data. On the other hand, it has been observed
that they are rather robust against noise in the training labels. This opens up
the intriguing possibility to avoid annotating huge amounts of training data,
and instead train the classifier from existing legacy data or crowd-sourced
maps which can exhibit high levels of noise. The question addressed in this
paper is: can training with large-scale, publicly available labels replace a
substantial part of the manual labeling effort and still achieve sufficient
performance? Such data will inevitably contain a significant portion of errors,
but in return virtually unlimited quantities of it are available in larger

imaging applications such as lesion segmentation where the number of lesion
voxels is often much lower than the number of non-lesion voxels. Training with
unbalanced data can lead to predictions that are severely biased towards high
precision but low recall (sensitivity), which is undesired especially in
medical applications where false negatives are much less tolerable than false
positives. Several methods have been proposed to deal with this problem
including balanced sampling, two step training, sample re-weighting, and
similarity loss functions. In this paper, we propose a generalized loss
function based on the Tversky index to address the issue of data imbalance and
achieve much better trade-off between precision and recall in training 3D fully

image pixels close to kidney boundary instead of building a graph of the whole
image. To make the kidney segmentation robust to weak boundaries, we adopt
localized regional information to measure similarity between image pixels for
computing edge weights to build the graph of image pixels. The localized graph

Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to
have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with
upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense
prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the
resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional
Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of
filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of
parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial
pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP
probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple
sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as
image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object
boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models.
The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs
achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this
by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected
Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and
quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed ""DeepLab""
system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image
segmentation task, reaching 79.7% mIOU in the test set, and advances the
results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and
Cityscapes. All of our code is made publicly available online."

of image pixels, which are similar in color or intensity, are an informative
representation for an object. They are therefore particularly suitable for
computer vision tasks, such as saliency detection and object proposal
generation. However, image pixels, which share a similar real-world color, may
be quite different since colors are often distorted by intensity. In this
paper, we reinvestigate the affinity matrices originally used in image
segmentation methods based on spectral clustering. A new affinity matrix, which
is robust to color distortions, is formulated for object discovery. Moreover, a
Cohesion Measurement (CM) for object regions is also derived based on the
formulated affinity matrix. Based on the new Cohesion Measurement, a novel
object discovery method is proposed to discover objects latent in an image by
utilizing the eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. Then we apply the proposed
method to both saliency detection and object proposal generation. Experimental
results on several evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CM based
method has achieved promising performance for these two tasks."

  A single CNN is trained to segment six tissues in MR brain images, the
pectoral muscle in MR breast images, and the coronary arteries in cardiac CTA.
The CNN therefore learns to identify the imaging modality, the visualised
anatomical structures, and the tissue classes.
  For each of the three tasks (brain MRI, breast MRI and cardiac CTA), this
combined training procedure resulted in a segmentation performance equivalent
to that of a CNN trained specifically for that task, demonstrating the high
capacity of CNN architectures. Hence, a single system could be used in clinical

advantages of both conditional random fields (CRFs) and decision trees. In the
literature, the potential functions of CRFs are mostly defined as a linear
combination of some pre-defined parametric models, and then methods like
structured support vector machines (SSVMs) are applied to learn those linear
coefficients. We instead formulate the unary and pairwise potentials as
nonparametric forests---ensembles of decision trees, and learn the ensemble
parameters and the trees in a unified optimization problem within the
large-margin framework. In this fashion, we easily achieve nonlinear learning
of potential functions on both unary and pairwise terms in CRFs. Moreover, we
learn class-wise decision trees for each object that appears in the image. Due
to the rich structure and flexibility of decision trees, our approach is
powerful in modelling complex data likelihoods and label relationships. The
resulting optimization problem is very challenging because it can have
exponentially many variables and constraints. We show that this challenging
optimization can be efficiently solved by combining a modified column
generation and cutting-planes techniques. Experimental results on both binary
(Graz-02, Weizmann horse, Oxford flower) and multi-class (MSRC-21, PASCAL VOC
2012) segmentation datasets demonstrate the power of the learned nonlinear
nonparametric potentials."

the competition is to perform a segmentation (in the form of a binary mask
image) of skin lesions in dermoscopic images as close as possible to a
segmentation performed by trained clinicians, which is taken as ground truth.
This project only takes part in the segmentation phase of the challenge. The
other phases of the competition (feature extraction and lesion identification)
are not considered.
  The proposed algorithm consists of 4 steps: (1) lesion image preprocessing,
(2) image segmentation using k-means clustering of pixel colors, (3)
calculation of a set of features describing the properties of each segmented
region, and (4) calculation of a final score for each region, representing the
likelihood of corresponding to a suitable lesion segmentation. The scores in
step (4) are obtained by averaging the results of 2 different regression models
using the scores of each region as input. Before using the algorithm these
regression models must be trained using the training set of images and ground
truth masks provided by the Competition. Steps 2 to 4 are repeated with an
increasing number of clusters (and therefore the image is segmented into more
regions) until there is no further improvement of the calculated scores."

segmentation in ultrasound images. Shape prior can provide strong guidance in
estimating the missing boundary, but traditional shape models often suffer from
hand-crafted descriptors and local information loss in the fitting procedure.
In this paper, we attempt to address those issues with a novel framework. The
proposed framework can seamlessly integrate feature extraction and shape prior
exploring, and estimate the complete boundary with a sequential manner. Our
framework is composed of three key modules. Firstly, we serialize the static 2D
prostate ultrasound images into dynamic sequences and then predict prostate
shapes by sequentially exploring shape priors. Intuitively, we propose to learn
the shape prior with the biologically plausible Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs). This module is corroborated to be effective in dealing with the
boundary incompleteness. Secondly, to alleviate the bias caused by different
serialization manners, we propose a multi-view fusion strategy to merge shape
predictions obtained from different perspectives. Thirdly, we further implant
the RNN core into a multiscale Auto-Context scheme to successively refine the
details of the shape prediction map. With extensive validation on challenging
prostate ultrasound images, our framework bridges severe boundary
incompleteness and achieves the best performance in prostate boundary
delineation when compared with several advanced methods. Additionally, our
approach is general and can be extended to other medical image segmentation
tasks, where boundary incompleteness is one of the main challenges."

problem. Integrating statistical prior information about the shapes to be
segmented can improve the segmentation results significantly. Most shape-based
segmentation algorithms optimize an energy functional and find a point estimate
for the object to be segmented. This does not provide a measure of the degree
of confidence in that result, neither does it provide a picture of other
probable solutions based on the data and the priors. With a statistical view,
addressing these issues would involve the problem of characterizing the
posterior densities of the shapes of the objects to be segmented. For such
characterization, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling-based
image segmentation algorithm that uses statistical shape priors. In addition to
better characterization of the statistical structure of the problem, such an
approach would also have the potential to address issues with getting stuck at
local optima, suffered by existing shape-based segmentation methods. Our
approach is able to characterize the posterior probability density in the space
of shapes through its samples, and to return multiple solutions, potentially
from different modes of a multimodal probability density, which would be
encountered, e.g., in segmenting objects from multiple shape classes. We
present promising results on a variety of data sets. We also provide an
extension for segmenting shapes of objects with parts that can go through
independent shape variations. This extension involves the use of local shape
priors on object parts and provides robustness to limitations in shape training

manual extraction of this information is very time-consuming, there has been
extensive research effort to automatically segment the neurons to help guide

comparatively less research on automatically detecting the actual synapses

factors: obtaining neuronal shapes is a prerequisite first step in extracting a
connectome, manual tracing is much more time-consuming than annotating
synapses, and neuronal contact area can be used as a proxy for synapses in
determining connections.

sufficient predictor of synaptic connection. Moreover, as segmentation has
improved, we have observed that synapse annotation is consuming a more
significant fraction of overall reconstruction time. This ratio will only get
worse as segmentation improves, gating overall possible speed-up. Therefore, we
address this problem by developing algorithms that automatically detect
pre-synaptic neurons and their post-synaptic partners. In particular,
pre-synaptic structures are detected using a Deep and Wide Multiscale Recursive
Network, and post-synaptic partners are detected using a MLP with features
conditioned on the local segmentation.
  This work is novel because it requires minimal amount of training, leverages
advances in image segmentation directly, and provides a complete solution for
polyadic synapse detection. We further introduce novel metrics to evaluate our
algorithm on connectomes of meaningful size. These metrics demonstrate that
complete automatic prediction can be used to effectively characterize most
connectivity correctly."

values, the weights being equal to the inverse of the number of horizontal and
vertical moves required to reach a neighborhood pixel from the center pixel.
These weights are used to vary the contributions of the different nuclei in the
Kernel based framework. The paper also presents an edge quality metric obtained
by fuzzy decision based edge candidate selection and final computation of the
blurriness of the edges after their selection. The inability of existing
algorithms to preserve edge information and structural details in their
segmented maps necessitates the computation of the edge quality factor (EQF)

been rendered with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms and for images ridden

bioinformatics, speech or text recognition is often done best by taking into

Structural support vector machines (SSVMs) are nonprobabilistic models that
optimize a joint input-output function through margin-based learning. Because
SSVMs generally disregard the interplay between unary and interaction factors
during the training phase, final parameters are suboptimal. Moreover, its
factors are often restricted to linear combinations of input features, limiting
its generalization power. To improve prediction accuracy, this paper proposes:
(i) Joint inference and learning by integration of back-propagation and
loss-augmented inference in SSVM subgradient descent; (ii) Extending SSVM
factors to neural networks that form highly nonlinear functions of input
features. Image segmentation benchmark results demonstrate improvements over
conventional SSVM training methods in terms of accuracy, highlighting the
feasibility of end-to-end SSVM training with neural factors."

estimators, we obviate the need to learn or evaluate potential functions for

otherwise when performing structured learning for a CRF with CNN potentials it
is necessary to undertake expensive inference for every stochastic gradient
iteration. The network output dimension for message estimation is the same as
the number of classes, in contrast to the network output for general CNN
potential functions in CRFs, which is exponential in the order of the
potentials. Hence CNN message learning has fewer network parameters and is more
scalable for cases that a large number of classes are involved. We apply our
method to semantic image segmentation on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. We
achieve an intersection-over-union score of 73.4 on its test set, which is the

must be processed sequentially in daily practice. The use of evolving fuzzy
systems for designing a method that automatically adjusts parameters to segment
medical images according to the quality expectation of expert users has been
proposed recently (Evolving fuzzy image segmentation EFIS). However, EFIS
suffers from a few limitations when used in practice mainly due to some fixed
parameters. For instance, EFIS depends on auto-detection of the object of
interest for feature calculation, a task that is highly application-dependent.
This shortcoming limits the applicability of EFIS, which was proposed with the
ultimate goal of offering a generic but adjustable segmentation scheme. In this
paper, a new version of EFIS is proposed to overcome these limitations. The new
EFIS, called self-configuring EFIS (SC-EFIS), uses available training data to
self-estimate the parameters that are fixed in EFIS. As well, the proposed
SC-EFIS relies on a feature selection process that does not require
auto-detection of an ROI. The proposed SC-EFIS was evaluated using the same
segmentation algorithms and the same dataset as for EFIS. The results show that
SC-EFIS can provide the same results as EFIS but with a higher level of

However, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of probabilistic models over these
same structured spaces requires computing partition functions, which is
generally intractable. This paper presents a method for learning discrete
exponential family models using the Bethe approximation to the MLE. Remarkably,
this problem also reduces to iterative (MAP) decoding. This connection emerges
by combining the Bethe approximation with a Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm on a
convex dual objective which circumvents the intractable partition function. The
result is a new single loop algorithm MLE-Struct, which is substantially more
efficient than previous double-loop methods for approximate maximum likelihood

propagation methods have been developed to exploit pairwise constraints for
cluster analysis. However, since most of these methods have a polynomial time
complexity, they are not much suitable for segmentation of images even with a
moderate size, which is actually equivalent to cluster analysis with a large
data size. Considering the local homogeneousness of a natural image, we choose
to perform pairwise constraint propagation only over a selected subset of
pixels, but not over the whole image. Such a selective constraint propagation
problem is then solved by an efficient graph-based learning algorithm. To
further speed up our selective constraint propagation, we also discard those
less important propagated constraints during graph-based learning. Finally, the
selectively propagated constraints are exploited based on $L_1$-minimization
for normalized cuts over the whole image. The experimental results demonstrate
the promising performance of the proposed method for segmentation with

appearance of segmentation. The approach operates in two phases: the first
phase is to make an over-segmentation which gives superpixels card. In the
second phase, we model the superpixels by a Bayesian Network. To find the

propagation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for pixelwise classification
on images. For pixelwise classification tasks, such as image segmentation and
object detection, surrounding image patches are fed into CNN for predicting the
classes of centered pixels via forward propagation and for updating CNN
parameters via backward propagation. However, forward and backward propagation
was originally designed for whole-image classification. Directly applying it to
pixelwise classification in a patch-by-patch scanning manner is extremely
inefficient, because surrounding patches of pixels have large overlaps, which
lead to a lot of redundant computation.
  The proposed algorithms eliminate all the redundant computation in
convolution and pooling on images by introducing novel d-regularly sparse
kernels. It generates exactly the same results as those by patch-by-patch
scanning. Convolution and pooling operations with such kernels are able to
continuously access memory and can run efficiently on GPUs. A fraction of
patches of interest can be chosen from each training image for backward
propagation by applying a mask to the error map at the last CNN layer. Its
computation complexity is constant with respect to the number of patches
sampled from the image. Experiments have shown that our proposed algorithms
speed up commonly used patch-by-patch scanning over 1500 times in both forward

emphasize the object of interest (OOI) within an image. Thus, low DOF images
are widely used in the application area of macro, portrait or sports
photography. When viewing a low DOF image, the viewer implicitly concentrates
on the regions that are sharper regions of the image and thus segments the
image into regions of interest and non regions of interest which has a major
impact on the perception of the image. Thus, a robust algorithm for the fully
automatic detection of the OOI in low DOF images provides valuable information
for subsequent image processing and image retrieval. In this paper we propose a
robust and parameterless algorithm for the fully automatic segmentation of low
DOF images. We compare our method with three similar methods and show the
superior robustness even though our algorithm does not require any parameters
to be set by hand. The experiments are conducted on a real world data set with
high and low DOF images."

Computer Vision and many industrial applications require segmenting a known
object into its components. Examples include identifying individual parts of a
component for process control work in a manufacturing plant and identifying
parts of a car from a photo for automatic damage detection. Unfortunately most
of an object's parts of interest in such applications share the same pixel
characteristics, having similar colour and texture. This makes segmenting the
object into its components a non-trivial task for conventional image
segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a ""Model Assisted
Segmentation"" method to tackle this problem. A 3D model of the object is
registered over the given image by optimising a novel gradient based loss
function. This registration obtains the full 3D pose from an image of the
object. The image can have an arbitrary view of the object and is not limited
to a particular set of views. The segmentation is subsequently performed using
a level-set based method, using the projected contours of the registered 3D
model as initialisation curves. The method is fully automatic and requires no
user interaction. Also, the system does not require any prior training. We
present our results on photographs of a real car."

considers basic regions and boundary elements. The corresponding optimization
problem is cast as an integer linear program.

again cast as an integer linear program. Here, we are considering pairs of
boundary elements to reflect curvature. Moreover, a constraint set is derived
to ensure that the boundary variables indeed reflect the boundary of the
regions described by the region variables.
  We show that by solving the linear programming relaxation one gets quite
close to the global optimum, and that curvature regularity is indeed much
better suited in the presence of long and thin objects compared to standard
length regularity."

been studied across a wide range of environments, including crawling on
substrates, swimming in fluids, and locomoting through microfluidic substrates.
However, each environment often requires customized image processing tools

Multi-Environment Model Estimation (MEME) framework for automated image
segmentation that is versatile across various environments. The MEME platform
is constructed around the concept of Mixture of Gaussian (MOG) models, where
statistical models for both the background environment and the nematode
appearance are explicitly learned and used to accurately segment a target
nematode. Our method is designed to simplify the burden often imposed on users;
here, only a single image which includes a nematode in its environment must be
provided for model learning. In addition, our platform enables the extraction
of nematode `skeletons' for straightforward motility quantification. We test
our algorithm on various locomotive environments and compare performances with
an intensity-based thresholding method. Overall, MEME outperforms the
threshold-based approach for the overwhelming majority of cases examined.
Ultimately, MEME provides researchers with an attractive platform for C.
elegans' segmentation and `skeletonizing' across a wide range of motility
assays."

challenging because of the variety of hand shapes and hand motions. Here, this
paper proposes to apply a combination of image segmentation with restoration

quality measures are conceded here to differentiate the methods both
subjectively as well as objectively. Experiments show that the additional use
of the restoration before segmenting the postures significantly improves the
correct rate of hand detection, and that the discrete derivatives yields a high
rate of discrimination between different static hand postures as well as
between hand postures and the scene background. Eventually, the research is to
contribute to the implementation of automated sign language recognition system

mixing graphs, we show that the cost functions introduced by Shi and Malik can
be well approximated as the rate of loss of predictive information about the

revealing details of their interactions with ambient environments. Currently
available environmental capsules are equipped with thin electron transparent
membranes and allow imaging the samples at atmospheric pressure. However these
capsules do not provide the temperature control over the sample. Here we
developed and tested a thermoelectric cooling / heating setup for available
environmental capsules to allow ambient pressure in situ SEM studies over the
-15 {\deg}C to 100 {\deg}C temperature range in gaseous, liquid, and frozen
environments. The design of the setup also allows correlation of the SEM with
optical microscopy and spectroscopy. As a demonstration of the possibilities of
the developed approach, we performed real-time in situ microscopy studies of
water condensation on a surface of wing scales of Morpho sulkowskyi butterfly.
We have found that the initial water nucleation takes place on the top of the
scale ridges. These results confirmed earlier discovery of a polarity gradient
of the ridges of Morpho butterflies. Our developed thermoelectric cooling /
heating setup for available SEM environmental capsules promises to impact
diverse needs for in-situ nano-characterization including materials science and
catalysis, micro-instrumentation and device reliability, chemistry and biology.

a root of unity if m>C. In our proofs, we use effective results for Thue

generalized Poisson submanifolds and generalized Poisson transversals,
submanifolds which look complex, respectively symplectic in transverse

holomorphic ideal and give a necessary and sufficient condition for the
corresponding blow-up to be generalized complex. For the generalized Poisson
transversals we give a normal form for a neighborhood of the submanifold, and
use that to define a generalized complex blow-up, which is up to deformation
independent of choices.

tetrahedra with icosahedral symmetry. This quasicrystalline packing was
achieved through two independent approaches. The first approach originates in
the Elser-Sloane 4D quasicrystal. A 3D slice of the quasicrystal contains a few
types of prototiles. An initial structure is obtained by decorating these
prototiles with tetrahedra. This initial structure is then modified using the
Elser-Sloane quasicrystal itself as a guide. The second approach proceeds by
decorating the prolate and oblate rhombohedra in a 3-dimensional Ammann tiling.
The resulting quasicrystal has a packing density of 59.783%. We also show a
variant of the quasicrystal that has just 10 ""plane classes"" (compared with the
190 of the original), defined as the total number of distinct orientations of
the planes in which the faces of the tetrahedra are contained. This small
number of plane classes was achieved by a certain ""golden rotation"" of the
tetrahedra.

method efficiently identifies basic unit cells and topological defects in
systems with low disorder and may analyze general amorphous structures to
identify candidate natural structures where a clear definition of order is
lacking. This general unbiased detection of physical structure does not require

a novel measure, the maximal information coefficient (MIC). Recently a PNAS
paper (Kinney and Atwal, 2014) gave a mathematical definition for equitability.
They proved that MIC in fact is not equitable, while a fundamental information
theoretic measure, the mutual information (MI), is self-equitable. In this
paper, we show that MI also does not correctly reflect the proportion of
deterministic signals hidden in noisy data. We propose a new equitability
definition based on this scenario. The copula correlation (Ccor), based on the
L1-distance of copula density, is shown to be equitable under both definitions.
We also prove theoretically that Ccor is much easier to estimate than MI.
Numerical studies illustrate the properties of the measures.

measurable subspaces that characterize meaningful functional integrals and a
scheme that possesses significant potential for representing non-commutative
Banach algebras suitable for mathematical physics applications. The framework
includes, within a broader structure, other successful approaches to define
functional integrals in restricted cases, and it suggests new and potentially
useful functional integrals that go beyond the standard Gaussian case. In
particular, functional integrals based on skew-Hermitian and K\""{a}hler
quadratic forms are defined and developed. Also defined are gamma-type and

noise spectra of photon atom interactions. Applying light with frequency
modulation, we can also observe the spontaneous noise reflecting the coherence
between the hyperfine levels in the excited state. There are two in novel
components in the measurement system, the noise reduction scheme and the
stabilization of the laser system. The noise reduction mechanism can be used to
reduce the shot noise contribution to arbitrarily low levels through averaging,
in principle. This is combined with differential detection to keep unwanted
noise at low levels. The laser system is stabilized to obtain spectral width
below 1\,kHz without high frequency ($\gtrsim10\,$MHz) noise. These methods are
described systematically and the performance of the asurement system is

with matching edges capturing timing constraints. When a family of graphs has
bounded tree-width, they can be interpreted in trees and MSO-definable
properties of such graphs can be checked using tree automata. The technique is
quite general and applies to many timed systems. In this paper, as an example,
we develop the technique on timed pushdown systems, which have recently
received considerable attention. Further, we also demonstrate how we can use it
on timed automata and timed multi-stack pushdown systems (with boundedness
restrictions).

We establish that every finitely executable behaviour can be specified in the

Euler class, that is the Euler class of the normal bundle to a combing
representative in the tangent bundle of the 3-manifold $M$. It only depends on
the Spin$^c$-structure represented by the combing. When this Euler class is a
torsion element of $H^2(M;Z)$, we say that the combing is a torsion combing.
Gompf introduced a $Q$-valued invariant $\theta_G$ of torsion combings of
closed 3-manifolds that distinguishes all combings that represent a given
Spin$^c$-structure. This invariant provides a grading of the Heegaard Floer
homology $\hat{HF}$ for manifolds equipped with torsion Spin$^c$-structures. We
give an alternative definition of the Gompf invariant and we express its
variation as a linking number. We also define a similar invariant $p_1$ for
combings of manifolds bounded by $S^2$. We show that the $\Theta$-invariant,
that is the simplest configuration space integral invariant of rational
homology spheres, is naturally an invariant of combings of rational homology
balls, that reads $(\frac14p_1 + 6 \lambda)$ where $\lambda$ is the
Casson-Walker invariant. The article also includes a mostly self-contained

effective in-plane easy axis from [-110] to [110] direction close to the Curie
temperature. The behavior of magnetization is described by anisotropy fields,
H_{eff} (= 4\piM -H_{2\perp}), H_{2\parallel}, and H_{4\parallel}. In order to
precisely investigate this reorientation, numerical values of anisotropy fields
have been determined using powerful - but still largely unknown - interval
calculations. In simulation mode this approach makes possible to find all the
resonance fields for arbitrarily oriented sample, which is generally
intractable analytically. In 'fitting' mode we effectively utilize full
experimental information, not only those measurements performed in special,
distinguished directions, to reliably estimate the values of important physical
parameters as well as their uncertainties and correlations.

does not vanish almost everywhere) then the equation equipped with constant
boundary condition has no solutions. In particular, due to a connection between
the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and the Monge-Amp\`ere equation,
the pressure $p$ in 2D Navier-Stokes equations on a bounded domain cannot
satisfy $\Delta p \leq 0$ in $\Omega $ unless $\Delta p \equiv 0$ (at any fixed

describe a correspondence between the action of a Galois group and the
dynamical action of a rational map. For nonlinear polynomials with rational
coefficients, the irreducibility of the associated dynatomic polynomial serves
as a convenient criterion, although we also verify that the correspondence
occurs in several cases when the dynatomic polynomial is reducible. The work of
Morton, Morton-Patel, and Vivaldi-Hatjispyros in the early 1990s connected the
irreducibility and Galois-theoretic properties of dynatomic polynomials to
rational periodic points; from the Galois-dynamics correspondence, we derive
similar consequences for quadratic periodic points of unicritical polynomials.
This is sufficient to deduce the non-existence of quadratic periodic points of
quadratic polynomials with exact period 5 and 6, outside of a specified finite
set from Morton and Krumm's work in explicit Hilbert irreducibility.

flavor-blind transmission of supersymmetry breaking from the hidden sector to
the visible sector. However, the pure AMSB scenario suffers from a serious
drawback, namely, the tachyonic slepton problem, and needs to be extended. The
so-called (positively) deflected AMSB is a simple extension to solve the
problem and also provides us with the usual neutralino lightest superpartner as
a good candidate for dark matter in the Universe. Motivated by the recent
discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments, we
perform the parameter scan in the deflected AMSB scenario by taking into
account a variety of phenomenological constraints such as the dark matter relic
density and the observed Higgs boson mass around 125-126 GeV. We identify the
allowed parameter region and list benchmark mass spectra. We find that in most
of the allowed parameter regions, the dark matter neutralino is Higgsino-like
and its elastic scattering cross section with nuclei is within the future reach
of the direct dark matter search experiments, while (colored) sparticles are
quite heavy and their discovery at the LHC is challenging.

optical modes that without direct interaction become quantum correlated after
the transfer. The output Gaussian quantum discord can be higher than the
initial Gaussian quantum discord when optimal gain of the classical channel and
the ancillary state are chosen. The physical reason for this result comes from
the fact that the quantum discord of an asymmetric Gaussian quantum discordant
state can be higher than that of a symmetric one. The presented scheme has

convergence acceleration of the fixed point iteration are tested. In
particular, Aitken relaxation, minimal polynomial extrapolation (MPE) and

single-molecule junctions by measuring the conductance of pyridine-based
molecules using Ag and Au electrodes. Our experiments are carried out using the
scanning tunneling microscope based break-junction technique and are supported
by density functional theory based calculations. We find from both experiments
and calculations that the coupling of the dominant transport orbital to the
metal is stronger for Au-based junctions when compared with Ag-based junctions.
We attribute this difference to relativistic effects, which results in an
enhanced density of d-states at the Fermi energy for Au compared with Ag. We
further show that the alignment of the conducting orbital relative to the Fermi
level does not follow the work function difference between two metals and is
different for conjugated and saturated systems. We thus demonstrate that the
details of the molecular level alignment and electronic coupling in
metal-organic interfaces do not follow simple rules, but are rather the
consequence of subtle local interactions.

multiple scattering encodes structure factor phases in the diffracted

retrieval of both amplitudes and phases of electron structure factors from
diffraction patterns recorded with varying angle of incidence will be
demonstrated. No assumption about the scattering potential itself is being
made. In particular, the resolution in the diffraction data does not need to be
sufficient to resolve atoms, making this method potentially interesting for
electron crystallography of 2-dimensional protein crystals and other

stems from the use of comprehensive stringwise operational transformations,
which appear to have escaped a formal treatment until now. Because these
transformations sometimes lead to an increase in the number of operations as
they are transformed, we cannot use inductive methods and adopt the novel idea
of decreasing diagrams instead. We also base our algorithm on a client-server

operational transformations to both newly generated and pending operations. And
lastly we solve the problem of latency, so that our algorithm works perfectly

see that one can have cosmic variance limited reconstruction of the intrinsic

lossless data compression for efficient storage and transmission. We present a
novel lossless universal data compression algorithm that uses parallel
computational units to increase the throughput. The length-$N$ input sequence
is partitioned into $B$ blocks. Processing each block independently of the
other blocks can accelerate the computation by a factor of $B$, but degrades
the compression quality. Instead, our approach is to first estimate the minimum
description length (MDL) context tree source underlying the entire input, and
then encode each of the $B$ blocks in parallel based on the MDL source. With
this two-pass approach, the compression loss incurred by using more parallel
units is insignificant. Our algorithm is work-efficient, i.e., its
computational complexity is $O(N/B)$. Its redundancy is approximately
$B\log(N/B)$ bits above Rissanen's lower bound on universal compression
performance, with respect to any context tree source whose maximal depth is at
most $\log(N/B)$. We improve the compression by using different quantizers for
states of the context tree based on the number of symbols corresponding to
those states. Numerical results from a prototype implementation suggest that
our algorithm offers a better trade-off between compression and throughput than
competing universal data compression algorithms.

  Efficient Approximation Algorithms",,"  This paper studies the coordinated beamforming (CoBF) design for the
multiple-input single-output interference channel, provided that only channel
distribution information is known to the transmitters. The problem under
consideration is a probabilistically constrained optimization problem which
maximizes a predefined system utility subject to constraints on rate outage
probability and power budget of each transmitter. Our recent analysis has shown
that the outage-constrained CoBF problem is intricately difficult, e.g.,
NP-hard. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on suboptimal but
computationally efficient algorithms. Specifically, by leveraging on the block
successive upper bound minimization (BSUM) method in optimization, we propose a
Gauss-Seidel type algorithm, called distributed BSUM algorithm, which can
handle differentiable, monotone and concave system utilities. By exploiting a
weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) reformulation, we further propose a
Jocobi-type algorithm, called distributed WMMSE algorithm, which can optimize
the weighted sum rate utility in a fully parallel manner. To provide a
performance benchmark, a relaxed approximation method based on polyblock outer
approximation is also proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed
algorithms are significantly superior to the existing successive convex
approximation method in both performance and computational efficiency, and can
yield promising approximation performance.

same linear-in-the-parameter model, with as many parameters as available
samples as in kernel-based machines. Sparse approximation is essential in many
disciplines, with new challenges emerging in online learning with kernels. To
this end, several sparsity measures have been proposed in the literature to
quantify sparse dictionaries and constructing relevant ones, the most prolific
ones being the distance, the approximation, the coherence and the Babel
measures. In this paper, we analyze sparse dictionaries based on these
measures. By conducting an eigenvalue analysis, we show that these sparsity
measures share many properties, including the linear independence condition and
inducing a well-posed optimization problem. Furthermore, we prove that there
exists a quasi-isometry between the parameter (i.e., dual) space and the
dictionary's induced feature space.

  In particular, we generalise results obtained by S. Glied and M. Baake [1,2]

group $\mathrm{OS}(M)/\mathrm{OC}(M)$ is Abelian for arbitrary
$\mathbb{Z}$-modules $M$, where $\mathrm{OS}(M)$ and $\mathrm{OC}(M)$ are the
groups of similar and coincidence isometries, respectively. In addition, we
derive various relations between the indices of CSLs and their corresponding
similar sublattices.

  Detectors",,"  The effects of residual amplitude modulation (RAM) in laser interferometers
using heterodyne sensing can be substantial and difficult to mitigate. In this
work, we analyze the effects of RAM on a complex laser interferometer used for
gravitational wave detection. The RAM introduces unwanted offsets in the cavity
length signals and thereby shifts the operating point of the optical cavities
from the nominal point via feedback control. This shift causes variations in
the sensing matrix, and leads to degradation in the performance of the
precision noise subtraction scheme of the multiple-degree-of-freedom control
system. In addition, such detuned optical cavities produce an opto-mechanical
spring, which also varies the sensing matrix. We use our simulations to derive
requirements on RAM for the Advanced LIGO detectors, and show that the RAM
expected in Advanced LIGO will not limit its sensitivity.

spread out over the sky except for a 60 degree band centered on the Galactic
Equator. The data we analyze was measured, collected and published by others.
Here, we apply tests suitable for large-scale samples and find that the
polarization directions align with a significance of p = 1% by one test and are
correlated by a second test with p = 5%, each p-value uncertain within a factor
of about 2. The tests return a preferred Cartesian coordinate system that
fortuitously aligns well with the Milky Way Galaxy with a significance of p =
3%. Thus, the Hub Tests' results combined together imply the polarization
directions are correlated with a significance that is much less than 1%, which
is remarkable for such a large-scale sample.

self-stabilizing algorithms with the proof assistant Coq. We first define in
Coq the locally shared memory model with composite atomicity, the most commonly
used model in the self-stabilizing area. We then validate our framework by
certifying a non trivial part of an existing silent self-stabilizing algorithm
which builds a $k$-clustering of the network. We also certify a quantitative
property related to the output of this algorithm. Precisely, we show that the
computed $k$-clustering contains at most $\lfloor \frac{n-1}{k+1} \rfloor + 1$
clusterheads, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the network. To obtain these
results, we also developed a library which contains general tools related to
potential functions and cardinality of sets.

percolation) is a dynamic process on a graph where vertices change color from
white to black if they have at least $k$ black neighbors. An irreversible
$k$-conversion set of a graph $G$ is a subset $S$ of vertices of $G$ such that
the irreversible $k$-threshold process starting with $S$ black eventually
changes all vertices of $G$ to black. We show that deciding the existence of an
irreversible 2-conversion set of a given size is NP-complete, even for graphs
of maximum degree 4, which answers a question of Dreyer and Roberts.
Conversely, we show that for graphs of maximum degree 3, the minimum size of an
irreversible 2-conversion set can be computed in polynomial time. Moreover, we
find an optimal irreversible 3-conversion set for the toroidal grid,
simplifying constructions of Pike and Zou.

compressed measurements with known performance guarantees in the static case.
However, only a few methods have been proposed to tackle the recovery of
time-varying signals, and even fewer benefit from a theoretical analysis. In
this paper, we study the capacity of the Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm
(ISTA) and its continuous-time analogue the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA)
to perform this tracking in real time. ISTA is a well-known digital solver for
static sparse recovery, whose iteration is a first-order discretization of the
LCA differential equation. Our analysis shows that the outputs of both
algorithms can track a time-varying signal while compressed measurements are
streaming, even when no convergence criterion is imposed at each time step. The
L2-distance between the target signal and the outputs of both discrete- and
continuous-time solvers is shown to decay to a bound that is essentially
optimal. Our analyses is supported by simulations on both synthetic and real
data.

both sports competitions and in elections. A natural and well-studied question
is the tournament fixing problem (TFP): given the set of all pairwise match
outcomes, can a tournament organizer rig an SE tournament by adjusting the
initial seeding so that their favorite player wins? We prove new sufficient
conditions on the pairwise match outcome information and the favorite player,
under which there is guaranteed to be a seeding where the player wins the
tournament. Our results greatly generalize previous results. We also
investigate the relationship between the set of players that can win an SE
tournament under some seeding (so called SE winners) and other traditional
tournament solutions. In addition, we generalize and strengthen prior work on
probabilistic models for generating tournaments. For instance, we show that
\emph{every} player in an $n$ player tournament generated by the Condorcet
Random Model will be an SE winner even when the noise is as small as possible,
$p=\Theta(\ln n/n)$; prior work only had such results for $p\geq
\Omega(\sqrt{\ln n/n})$. We also establish new results for significantly more
general generative models.

  Application to hyperspectral unmixing",,"  This paper presents a new Bayesian collaborative sparse regression method for
linear unmixing of hyperspectral images. Our contribution is twofold; first, we
propose a new Bayesian model for structured sparse regression in which the
supports of the sparse abundance vectors are a priori spatially correlated
across pixels (i.e., materials are spatially organised rather than randomly
distributed at a pixel level). This prior information is encoded in the model
through a truncated multivariate Ising Markov random field, which also takes
into consideration the facts that pixels cannot be empty (i.e, there is at
least one material present in each pixel), and that different materials may
exhibit different degrees of spatial regularity. Secondly, we propose an
advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the posterior
probabilities that materials are present or absent in each pixel, and,
conditionally to the maximum marginal a posteriori configuration of the
support, compute the MMSE estimates of the abundance vectors. A remarkable
property of this algorithm is that it self-adjusts the values of the parameters
of the Markov random field, thus relieving practitioners from setting
regularisation parameters by cross-validation. The performance of the proposed
methodology is finally demonstrated through a series of experiments with
synthetic and real data and comparisons with other algorithms from the
literature.

  FCC, and diamond structures",,"  Proper inclusion of van der Waals (vdW) interactions in theoretical
simulations based on standard density functional theory (DFT) is crucial to
describe the physics and chemistry of systems such as organic and layered
materials. Many encouraging approaches have been proposed to combine vdW
interactions with standard approximate DFT calculations. Despite many vdW
studies, there is no consensus on the reliability of vdW methods. To help
further development of vdW methods, we have assessed various vdW functionals
through the calculation of structural prop- erties at equilibrium, such as
lattice constants, bulk moduli, and cohesive energies, for bulk solids,
including alkali, alkali-earth, and transition metals, with BCC, FCC, and
diamond structures as the ground state structure. These results provide
important information for the vdW-related materials research, which is
essential for designing and optimizing materials systems for desired physical
and chemical properties.

Denoting by $\rho$ the weight function, we compare the space $W^{1,p}(X,d,\rho

functions) with the weighted Sobolev spaces $W^{1,p}_\rho(X,d,m)$ and
$H^{1,p}_\rho(X,d,m)$ defined as in the Euclidean theory of weighted Sobolev
spaces. Under mild assumptions on the metric measure structure and on the
weight we show that $W^{1,p}(X,d,\rho m)=H^{1,p}_\rho(X,d, m)$. We also adapt
results by Muckenhoupt and recent work by Zhikov to the metric measure setting,
considering appropriate conditions on $\rho$ that ensure the equality
$W^{1,p}_\rho(X,d,m)=H^{1,p}_\rho(X,d,m)$.

equivalent to a projective space? We know that the unramified cohomology groups
of degree 1 and 2 of $\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{T}^c$ are reduced to their
constant part. For the analogue of the third cohomology groups, we give a
sufficient condition using the Galois structure of the geometrical Picard group

in many experimental applications reaching from quantum information processing
to frequency metrology. For the scalable quantum computer architectures based
on the shuttling of individual ions, different transport schemes have been
developed, which allow to move single atoms minimizing their energy gain. In
this article we discuss the experimental implementation of the transport of a
three-dimensional ion cloud in a macroscopic linear radiofrequency (RF) trap.
The present work is based on numerical simulations done by molecular dynamics
taking into account a realistic experimental environment. The deformation of
the trapping potential and the spatial extension of the cloud during transport
appears to be the major source of the ion energy gain. The efficiency of
transport in terms of transfer probability and ion number is also discussed.

photospheric motions acting on a continuous magnetic field will result in the
formation of tangential discontinuities corresponding to singular currents. We
review direct numerical simulations of the problem and find the evidence points
to a tendency for thin but finite thickness current layers to form, with
thickness exponentially decreasing in time. Given a finite resistivity these
layers will eventually become important and cause the dynamical process of
energy release. Accordingly, a body of work focusses on evolution under
continual boundary driving. The coronal volume evolves into a highly dynamic
but statistically steady state where quantities have a temporally and spatially
intermittent nature and where the Poynting flux and dissipation are decoupled
on short timescales. Although magnetic braiding is found to be a promising
coronal heating mechanism much work remains to determine its true viability.
Some suggestions for future study are offered.

errors in all the variables. First, we provide necessary and sufficient
conditions for identification of the coefficients. We show that the
coefficients are not identified if and only if an independent normally
distributed linear combination of regressors can be transferred from the
regressors to the errors. Second, we introduce a new estimator for the
coefficients using a continuum of moments that are based on second derivatives
of the log characteristic function of the observables. In Monte Carlo
simulations, the estimator performs well and is robust to the amount of
measurement error and number of mismeasured regressors. In an application to
firm investment decisions, the estimates are similar to those produced by a
generalized method of moments estimator based on third to fifth moments.

a novel result, we show bounds on the allowed number of spin-3/2
(Rarita-Schwinger) fields, e.g., the gravitino. These bounds, obtained within
truncated Renormalization Group flows, indicate the compatibility of asymptotic
safety with the matter fields of the standard model. Further, they suggest that
extensions of the matter content of the standard model are severely restricted
in asymptotic safety. This means that searches for new particles at colliders
could provide experimental tests for this particular approach to quantum

High quality single crystals were grown in In-flux. The compound undergoes a

increase of the resistivity $\rho$ with j along the [100], [110] and [001]

the niobium thin films on a silicon glass and BiOCl single crystal substrates

agreement with the McMillan model which indicates the strong influence of the
inverse proximity effect induced by the interface. The increased influence of
the BiOCl/Nb interface under laser excitation corresponds to the raising the

(2009)] has been widely used to describe large systems of coupled phase
oscillators. If the coupling is sinusoidal and if the phase dynamics does not
depend on the specific oscillator, then the macroscopic behavior of the systems
can be fully described by a low-dimensional dynamics. Does the corresponding
manifold remain attractive when introducing an intrinsic dependence between an
oscillator's phase and its dynamics by additional, oscillator specific
parameters? To answer this we extended the OA ansatz and proved that
parameter-dependent oscillatory systems converge to the OA manifold given
certain conditions. Our proof confirms recent numerical findings that already
hinted at this convergence. Furthermore we offer a thorough mathematical
underpinning for networks of so-called theta neurons, where the OA ansatz has
just been applied. In a final step we extend our proof by allowing for
time-dependent and multi-dimensional parameters as well as for network
topologies other than global coupling. This renders the OA ansatz an excellent
starting point for the analysis of a broad class of realistic settings.

represents a nonentire function $F=G/H^p$ where $G$ and $H$ are holomorphic and
$p$ is a positive integer. Given a direction $\alpha\in\pnats^d$ for which the
asymptotics are controlled by a smooth point of the singular variety $H = 0$,
we compute the asymptotics of $F_{n \alpha}$ as $n\to\infty$. We do this via
multivariate singularity analysis and give an explicit formula for the full
asymptotic expansion. This improves on earlier work of R. Pemantle and the
second author and allows for more accurate numerical approximation, as
demonstrated by our examples.

the Bloch sphere, the Majorana representation (MR) provide us an intuitive way
to study a physical system with SU(2) symmetry. In this work, based on coherent
states, we propose a method to establish generalization of MR for a general
symmetry. By choosing a generalized coherent state as a reference state, we
give a more general MR for both finite and infinite systems and the
corresponding star equations are given. Using this method, we study the
squeezed vacuum states for three different symmetries, Heisenberg-Weyl, SU(2)
and SU(1,1), and express the effect of squeezing parameter on the distribution
of stars. Furthermore, we also study the dynamical evolution of stars for an
initial coherent state driven by a nonlinear Hamiltonian, and find that at a
special time point, the stars are distributed on two orthogonal large circles.

second-order correlation function for the coherence, genuine two-mode

with particle entanglement. We identify regimes of distinct quantum statistical
character depending on the relative strength of photon-exchange and
nonlinearity. Moreover, we examine the effects of weak and strong drives on
these quantum statistical regimes.

finite number of connected components. We call the set tame if the assumption
is satisfied, and define a tame morphism in the same way.
  In this paper we will show that a tame topological manifold is carried by a
tame homeomorphism to the interior of a compact piecewise linear manifolds

boundary is unique up to piecewise linear homeomorphisms in the sense that if
two manifolds are such PL manifolds possibly with boundary then they are the
same as piecewise linear manifolds. We modify this to Theorem 2 so that
argument of model theory works, and we prove it. We also consider the

aperture synthesis array can be refocused on an object in the near field of an
array, provided that the object is smaller than the effective Fresnel zone size
corresponding to the array-object range. We show here that, under paraxial
conditions, standard interferometric techniques can be used to image objects
which are substantially larger than this limit. We also note that
interferometric self-calibration and phase-closure image reconstruction
techniques can be used to achieve near-field refocussing without requiring
accurate object range information. We use our results to show that the field of
view for high-resolution aperture synthesis imaging of geosynchronous
satellites from the ground can be considerably larger than the largest
satellites in Earth orbit.

  Spectrum Imaging Data Using Generalized Q-Sampling Conversion",,"  Many diffusion MRI researchers, including the Human Connectome Project (HCP),
acquire data using multishell (e.g., WU-Minn consortium) and diffusion spectrum
imaging (DSI) schemes (e.g., USC-Harvard consortium). However, these data sets
are not readily accessible to high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI)
analysis methods that are popular in connectomics analysis. Here we introduce a
scheme conversion approach that transforms multishell and DSI data into their
corresponding HARDI representations, thereby empowering HARDI-based analytical
methods to make use of data acquired using non-HARDI approaches. This method
was evaluated on both phantom and in-vivo human data sets by acquiring
multishell, DSI, and HARDI data simultaneously, and comparing the converted
HARDI, from non-HARDI methods, with the original HARDI data. Analysis on the
phantom shows that the converted HARDI from DSI and multishell data strongly
predicts the original HARDI (correlation coefficient > 0.9). Our in-vivo study
shows that the converted HARDI can be reconstructed by constrained spherical
deconvolution, and the fiber orientation distributions are consistent with
those from the original HARDI. We further illustrate that our scheme conversion
method can be applied to HCP data, and the converted HARDI do not appear to
sacrifice angular resolution. Thus this novel approach can benefit all
HARDI-based analysis approaches, allowing greater analytical accessibility to
non-HARDI data, including data from the HCP.

extremely precise estimation of very small galaxy shape distortions, in the
presence of far larger intrinsic galaxy shapes and distortions due to the
blurring kernel caused by the atmosphere, telescope optics, and instrumental
effects. The GREAT3 challenge is posed to the astronomy, machine learning, and
statistics communities, and includes tests of three specific effects that are
of immediate relevance to upcoming weak lensing surveys, two of which have
never been tested in a community challenge before. These effects include
realistically complex galaxy models based on high-resolution imaging from

of multiple different exposures. To facilitate entry by people new to the

understand resonant behavior of optical nanoantennas. We report high-resolution
CL spectroscopy of triangular gold nanoantennas designed with near-vacuum
effective index and very small metal-substrate interface. This design helped in
addressing issues related to background luminescence and shifting of dipole
modes beyond visible spectrum. Spatial and spectral investigations of various
plasmonic modes are reported. Out-of-plane dipole modes excited with vertically
illuminated electron beam showed high-contrast tip illumination in panchromatic
imaging. By tilting the nanostructures during fabrication, in-plane dipole
modes of antennas were excited. Finite-difference time-domain simulations for
electron and optical excitations of different modes showed excellent agreement
with experimental results. Our approach of efficiently exciting antenna modes
by using low index substrates is confirmed both with experiments and numerical
simulations. This should provide further insights into better understanding of
optical antennas for various applications.

mode-splitting, however, is either small or accompanied by undesired resonance
shifts, often much larger than the resonance-splitting. We report a control
mechanism that enables reconfigurable and widely tunable mode-splitting while
efficiently mitigating undesired resonance shifts. This is achieved by actively
controlling the excitation of counter-traveling modes in coupled resonators.
The transition from a large splitting (80 GHz) to a single-notch resonance is
demonstrated using low power microheaters (35 mW). We show that the spurious
resonance-shift in our device is only limited by thermal crosstalk and
resonance-shift-free splitting control may be achieved.

prove a de Rham theorem for locally contractible differentiable stratified

call the orbit Cartan type stratification. Endowed with this stratification,
the inertia groupoid of a proper Lie groupoid becomes a locally contractible

starting from traces of missing method calls in a bug repository. We propose a
new system that searches for missing method calls in software based on the

theory concept of majority rule holds for method calls: a call is likely to be
missing if there is a majority of similar pieces of code where this call is
present. The evaluation shows that the system predictions go further missing
method calls and often reveal different kinds of code smells (e.g. violations
of API best practices).

changes (open-close). Thanks to the mapping of time series signal into the
sequence of 2k+1 'spin-like' states, where k=0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, ..., we are able
to describe any time series increments, with almost arbitrary accuracy, as the
one of such 'spin-like' states. This procedure leads in the simplest
non-trivial case (k = 1/2) to the binary data projection. More sophisticated
projections are also possible and mentioned in the article. The introduced
formalism allows then to use Zipf power law to describe the intrinsic structure
of time series. The fast algorithm for this implementation was constructed by
us within Matlab^{TM} software. The method, called Zipf strategy, is then
applied in the simplest case k = 1/2 to WIG 20 open and close daily data to
make short-term predictions for forthcoming index changes. The results of
forecast effectiveness are presented with respect to different time window
sizes and partition divisions (word lengths in Zipf language). Finally, the
various investment strategies improving ROI (return of investment) for WIG20
futures are proposed. We show that the Zipf strategy is the appropriate and
very effective tool to make short-term predictions and therefore, to evaluate
short-term investments on the basis of historical stock index data. Our
findings support also the existence of long memory in financial data, exceeding
the known in literature 3 days span limit.

  atom",,"  Ultrathin nanopore membranes based on 2D materials have demonstrated ultimate
resolution toward DNA sequencing. Among them, molybdenum disulphide (MoS2)
shows long-term stability as well as superior sensitivity enabling high
throughput performance. The traditional method of fabricating nanopores with
nanometer precision is based on the use of focused electron beams in
transmission electron microscope (TEM). This nanopore fabrication process is
time-consuming, expensive, not scalable and hard to control below 1 nm. Here,
we exploited the electrochemical activity of MoS2 and developed a convenient
and scalable method to controllably make nanopores in single-layer MoS2 with
sub-nanometer precision using electrochemical reaction (ECR). The
electrochemical reaction on the surface of single-layer MoS2 is initiated at
the location of defects or single atom vacancy, followed by the successive
removals of individual atoms or unit cells from single-layer MoS2 lattice and
finally formation of a nanopore. Step-like features in the ionic current
through the growing nanopore provide direct feedback on the nanopore size
inferred from a widely used conductance vs. pore size model. Furthermore, DNA
translocations can be detected in-situ when as-fabricated MoS2 nanopores are
used. The atomic resolution and accessibility of this approach paves the way
for mass production of nanopores in 2D membranes for potential solid-state
nanopore sequencing.

terms of entropy numbers can be systematically improved when the underlying set

only for certain ""thin"" subsets. This phenomenon arises from the observation
that real interpolation can be used as a natural chaining mechanism. Unlike the
general form of Talagrand's generic chaining method, which is sharp but often
difficult to use, the resulting bounds involve only entropy numbers but are
nonetheless sharp in many situations in which classical entropy bounds are
suboptimal. Such bounds are readily amenable to explicit computations in
specific examples, and we discover some old and new geometric principles for
the control of chaining functionals as special cases.

are only about 50 pedestrians in the room, then they start to increase. This
suggests that at the last stage the flow is laminar. In the first stage,
clogging events slow the evacuation down. As they are more likely for larger

using a sensor array, in the asymptotic regime where the number of samples and

estimators were derived (termed as G-MUSIC) in previous works, and were shown
to be consistent and asymptotically Gaussian distributed in the case where the
number of sources and their DoA remain fixed. In this case, which models widely
spaced DoA scenarios, it is proved in the present paper that the traditional
MUSIC method also provides DoA consistent estimates having the same asymptotic
variances as the G-MUSIC estimates. The case of DoA that are spaced of the
order of a beamwidth, which models closely spaced sources, is also considered.
It is shown that G-MUSIC estimates are still able to consistently separate the
sources, while it is no longer the case for the MUSIC ones. The asymptotic
variances of G-MUSIC estimates are also evaluated.

are modeled by Gaussian processes. To model cross-covariance between sample
coordinates we introduce a class of low-dimensional cross-covariance structures
suitable for modeling multivariate functional data. We present a method for
doing maximum-likelihood estimation in the models and apply the method to three

spatial positions of a large number of body-markers are tracked in
three-dimensions over time. The second data set consists of height and weight
measurements for Danish boys. The third data set consists of three-dimensional

  non-commutative Sidon sets",,"  We present a proof of Rider's unpublished result that the union of two Sidon
sets in the dual of a non-commutative compact group is Sidon, and that randomly
Sidon sets are Sidon. Most likely this proof is essentially the one announced
by Rider and communicated in a letter to the author around 1979 (lost by him
since then). The key fact is a spectral gap property with respect to certain
representations of the unitary groups $U(n)$ that holds uniformly over $n$. The
proof crucially uses Weyl's character formulae. We survey the results that we
obtained 30 years ago using Rider's unpublished results. Using a recent
different approach valid for certain orthonormal systems of matrix valued
functions, we give a new proof of the spectral gap property that is required to
show that the union of two Sidon sets is Sidon. The latter proof yields a
rather good quantitative estimate. Several related results are discussed with
possible applications to random matrix theory.

  information causality",,"  Quantum mechanics is not the unique no-signaling theory which is endowed with
stronger-than-classical correlations, and there exists a broad class of
no-signaling theories allowing even stronger-than-quantum correlations. The
principle of information causality has been suggested to distinguish quantum
theory from these nonphysical theories, together with an elegant
information-theoretic proof of the quantum bound of two-particle correlations.
In this work, we extend this to genuine $N$-particle correlations that cannot
be reduced to mixtures of states in which a smaller number of particles are
entangled. We first express Svetlichny's inequality in terms of multipartite
no-signaling boxes, then prove that the strongest genuine multipartite
correlations lead to the maximal violation of information causality. The
maximal genuine multipartite correlations under the constraint of information
causality is found to be equal to the quantum mechanical bound. This result
consolidates information causality as a physical principle defining the
possible correlations allowed by nature, and provides intriguing insights into
the limits of genuine multipartite correlations in quantum theory.

  model",,"  The Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model can be interpreted as a generalization of the
Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model, possessing a family of fundamental
diagram curves, each of which represents a class of drivers with a different
empty road velocity. A weakness of this approach is that different drivers
possess vastly different densities at which traffic flow stagnates. This
drawback can be overcome by modifying the pressure relation in the ARZ model,
leading to the generalized Aw-Rascle-Zhang (GARZ) model. We present an approach
to determine the parameter functions of the GARZ model from fundamental diagram
measurement data. The predictive accuracy of the resulting data-fitted GARZ
model is compared to other traffic models by means of a three-detector test
setup, employing two types of data: vehicle trajectory data, and sensor data.
This work also considers the extension of the ARZ and the GARZ models to models
with a relaxation term, and conducts an investigation of the optimal relaxation
time.

  Resonators",,"  Light trapping in sub-wavelength semiconductor nanowires (NWs) offers a
promising approach to simultaneously reducing material consumption and
enhancing photovoltaic performance. Nevertheless, the absorption efficiency of
a NW, defined by the ratio of optical absorption cross section to the NW
diameter, lingers around 1 in existing NW photonic devices, and the absorption
enhancement suffers from a narrow spectral width. Here, we show that the
absorption efficiency can be significantly improved in NWs with higher
refractive indices, by an experimental observation of up to 350% external
quantum efficiency (EQE) in lead sulfide (PbS) NW resonators, a 3-fold increase
compared to Si NWs. Furthermore, broadband absorption enhancement is achieved
in single tapered NWs, where light of various wavelengths is absorbed at
segments with different diameters analogous to a tandem solar cell. Overall,
the single NW Schottky junction solar cells benefit from optical resonance,
near bandgap open circuit voltage, and long minority carrier diffusion length,
demonstrating power conversion efficiency (PCE) comparable to single Si NW
coaxial p-n junction cells11, but with much simpler fabrication processes.

radius formula holds, analogous to that for a globally defined bounded operator
on a Banach space with the single-valued extension property. An operator of the
class under consideration can occur in practice as (an extension of) a
differential operator which, roughly speaking, can be diagonalised on its
domain of smooth test functions via a discrete transform, such that the
diagonalising transform establishes an isomorphism of topological vector spaces
between the domain of the differential operator, in its own topology, and a
sequence space. We give concrete examples of (extensions of) such operators
(constant coefficient differential operators on the d-torus, Jacobi operators,
the Hermite operator, Laguerre operators) and indicate further perspectives.

screw translation $g$ acting on the 4-dimensional real hyperbolic space. This
is an invariant domain with the parabolic fixed point of $g$ on its boundary
which plays the role of an invariant horoball for a translation in dimensions
$\leq 3$. The boundary of the Margulis region is described in terms of a
function $B_\alpha : [0,\infty) \to {\mathbb R}$ which solely depends on the
rotation angle $\alpha \in {\mathbb R}/{\mathbb Z}$ of $g$. We obtain an
asymptotically universal upper bound for $B_\alpha(r)$ as $r \to \infty$ for
arbitrary irrational $\alpha$, as well as lower bounds when $\alpha$ is
Diophatine and the optimal bound when $\alpha$ is of bounded type. We

bi-Lipschitz rigidity of these cusps.

  Trapped Ion",,"  Spectral properties of the Hamiltonian function which characterizes a trapped
ion are investigated. In order to study semiclassical dynamics of trapped ions,
coherent state orbits are introduced as sub-manifolds of the quantum state
space, with the K\""ahler structure induced by the transition probability. The
time dependent variational principle (TDVP) is applied on coherent states'
orbits. The Hamilton equations of motion on K\""ahler manifolds of the type of
classical phase spaces naturally arise. The associated classical Hamiltonian is
obtained from the expected values on symplectic coherent states of the quantum
Hamiltonian. Spectral information is thus coded within the phase portrait. We
deal with the bosonic realization of the Lie algebra of the SU(1,1) group,
which we particularize for the case of an ion confined in a combined, Paul and
Penning trap. This formalism can be applied to Hamiltonians which are nonlinear
in the infinitesimal generators of a dynamical symmetry group, such as the case
of ions confined in electrodynamic traps. Discrete quasienergy spectra are
obtained and the corresponding quasienergy states are explicitly realized as
coherent states parameterized by the stable solutions of the corresponding
classical equations of motion. A correspondence between quantum and classical
stability domains is thus established, using the Husimi representation.

state is a superposition of two identical wave packets with opposite average
momentum, interacts during its evolution and exchanges (small amounts of)
energy with an array of localized spins. Triggered by the interaction with the
environment, the initial superposition state turns into an incoherent sum of
two states describing the following situation: or the particle is going to the
left and a large number of spins on the left side changed their states, or the
same is happening on the right side. This evolution is reminiscent of what
happens in a cloud chamber where a quantum particle, emitted as a spherical
wave by a radioactive source, marks its passage inside a supersaturated
vapour-chamber in the form of a sequence of small liquid bubbles arranging
themselves around a possible classical trajectory of the particle.

$Spin$ groups due to isomorphisms $Spin(3) \simeq SU(2)$ and $Spin(6) \simeq
SU(4)$. However, the group of $n$-qubit gates $SU(2^n)$ for $n > 2$ has bigger
dimension than $Spin(3n)$. A quantum circuit with one- and two-qubit gates may
be used for construction of arbitrary unitary transformation $SU(2^n)$.
Analogously, the `$Spin(3n)$ circuits' are introduced in this work as products
of elements associated with one- and two-qubit gates with respect to the
above-mentioned isomorphisms.
  The matrix tensor product implementation of the $Spin(3n)$ group together
with relevant models by usual quantum circuits with $2n$ qubits are
investigated in such a framework. A certain resemblance with well-known sets of
non-universal quantum gates e.g., matchgates, noninteracting-fermion quantum
circuits) related with $Spin(2n)$ may be found in presented approach. Finally,
a possibility of the classical simulation of such circuits in polynomial time
is discussed.

  energy",,"  By regarding the Lifshitz expression for the Casimir free energy on the real
frequency axis rather than the imaginary Matsubara frequencies as is customary,
new light is shed on the ongoing debate regarding the thermodynamical
consistency of this theory in combination with common permittivity models. It
is argued that when permittivity is temperature independent over a temperature
interval including zero temperature, a cavity made of causal material with
continuous dispersion properties separated by vacuum cannot violate Nernst's
theorem (the third law of thermodynamics). The purported violation of this
theorem pertains to divergencies in the double limit in which frequency and
temperature vanish simultaneously. While any model should abide by the laws of
thermodynamics within its range of applicability, we emphasise that the Nernst
heat theorem is a relevant criterion for choosing amongst candidate theories
only when these theories are fully applicable at zero temperature and
frequency.

  Correction",,"  We introduce a high-level graphical framework for designing and analysing
quantum error correcting codes, centred on what we term the coherent parity
check (CPC). The graphical formulation is based on the diagrammatic tools of
the zx-calculus of quantum observables. The resulting framework leads to a
construction for stabilizer codes that allows us to design and verify a broad
range of quantum codes based on classical ones, and that gives a means of
discovering large classes of codes using both analytical and numerical methods.
We focus in particular on the smaller codes that will be the first used by
near-term devices. We show how CSS codes form a subset of CPC codes and, more
generally, how to compute stabilizers for a CPC code. As an explicit example of
this framework, we give a method for turning almost any pair of classical
[n,k,3] codes into a [[2n - k + 2, k, 3]] CPC code. Further, we give a simple
technique for machine search which yields thousands of potential codes, and
demonstrate its operation for distance 3 and 5 codes. Finally, we use the
graphical tools to demonstrate how Clifford computation can be performed within
CPC codes. As our framework gives a new tool for constructing small- to
medium-sized codes with relatively high code rates, it provides a new source
for codes that could be suitable for emerging devices, while its zx-calculus
foundations enable natural integration of error correction with graphical
compiler toolchains. It also provides a powerful framework for reasoning about
all stabilizer quantum error correction codes of any size.

describing the type and degree of order in a system. For example, crystals
consist of spatially ordered arrays of atoms, an order that is lost as the
crystal melts. Like- wise in ferromagnets, the magnetic moments of the
constituent particles align only below the Curie temperature, TC. These two
examples reflect two classes of phase transitions: the melting of a crystal is
a first-order phase transition (the crystalline order vanishes abruptly) and
the onset of magnetism is a second- order phase transition (the magnetization
increases continuously from zero as the temperature falls below TC). Such
magnetism is robust in systems with localized magnetic particles, and yet rare
in model itinerant systems where the particles are free to move about. Here for
the first time, we explore the itinerant magnetic phases present in a spin-1
spin-orbit coupled atomic Bose gas; in this system, itinerant ferromagnetic
order is stabilized by the spin-orbit coupling, vanishing in its absence. We
first located a second-order phase transition that continuously stiffens until,
at a tricritical point, it transforms into a first- order transition (with
observed width as small as h x 4 Hz). We then studied the long-lived metastable
states associated with the first-order transition. These measurements are all
in agreement with theory.

of statistical seismic source inversion. In particular, we efficiently compute
the optimal number and locations of the receivers or seismographs. The seismic
source is modeled by a point moment tensor multiplied by a time-dependent
function. The parameters include the source location, moment tensor components,
and start time and frequency in the time function. The forward problem is
modeled by elastodynamic wave equations. We show that the Hessian of the cost
functional, which is usually defined as the square of the weighted L2 norm of
the difference between the experimental data and the simulated data, is
proportional to the measurement time and the number of receivers. Consequently,
the posterior distribution of the parameters, in a Bayesian setting,
concentrates around the ""true"" parameters, and we can employ Laplace
approximation and speed up the estimation of the expected Kullback-Leibler
divergence (expected information gain), the optimality criterion in the
experimental design procedure. Since the source parameters span several
magnitudes, we use a scaling matrix for efficient control of the condition
number of the original Hessian matrix. We use a second-order accurate finite
difference method to compute the Hessian matrix and either sparse quadrature or
Monte Carlo sampling to carry out numerical integration. We demonstrate the
efficiency, accuracy, and applicability of our method on a two-dimensional

the same way as they treat performances with the outcome virtually decided
(e.g. when one team leads by 30 points with one minute left). Because they
ignore the context in which players perform, these measures can result in
misleading estimates of how players help their teams win. We instead use a win
probability framework for evaluating the impact NBA players have on their
teams' chances of winning. We propose a Bayesian linear regression model to
estimate an individual player's impact, after controlling for the other players

highly paid players with low impact relative to their teammates, as well as

  Microscopes",,"  Atomic force microscopes have proved to be fundamental research tools in many
situations where a gentle imaging process is required, and in a variety of
environmental conditions, such as the study of biological samples. Among the
possible modes of operation, intermittent contact mode is one that causes less
wear to both the sample and the instrument; therefore, it is ideal when imaging
soft samples. However, intermittent contact mode is not particularly fast when
compared to other imaging strategies. In this paper, we introduce three
enhanced control approaches, applied at both the dither and z-axis piezos, to
address the limitations of existing control schemes. Our proposed strategies
are able to eliminate different image artefacts, automatically adapt scan speed
to the sample being scanned and predict its features in real time. The result
is that both the image quality and the scan time are improved.

  investigation",,"  Nanoparticles of high refractive index materials can possess strong magnetic
polarizabilities and give rise to artificial magnetism in the optical spectral
range. While the response of individual dielectric or metal spherical particles
can be described analytically via multipole decomposition in the Mie series,
the influence of substrates, in many cases present in experimental
observations, requires different approaches. Here, the comprehensive numerical
studies of the influence of a substrate on the spectral response of high- index
dielectric nanoparticles were performed. In particular, glass, perfect electric
conductor, gold, and hyperbolic metamaterial substrates were investigated.
Optical properties of nanoparticles were characterized via scattering
cross-section spectra, electric field profiles, and induced electric and
magnetic moments. The presence of substrates was shown to introduce significant
impact on particle's magnetic resonances and resonant scattering
cross-sections. Variation of substrate material provides an additional degree
of freedom in tailoring properties of emission of magnetic multipoles,
important in many applications.

used for RD suppression in T1 measurements. At 9.4 T, for the radiation damping
characteristic time (Trd) of 50 ms, these investigations show non-negligible RD
effects for T1 values greater than Trd, with severe distortions for T1 longer
than about 150 ms, showing reasonable agreement with the predicted Trd. We also
report a discrepancy between published expressions for the characteristic RD

recursion $xQ_n(x)=Q_{n+1}(x)+a_{n-p} Q_{n-p}(x)$ with arbitrary $p\geq 1$ and
$a_n>0$ for all $n$. The recursion is encoded by a two-diagonal Hessenberg
operator $H$. One of our main results is that, for periodic coefficients $a_n$
and under certain conditions, the $Q_n$ are multiple orthogonal polynomials
with respect to a Nikishin system of orthogonality measures supported on
star-like sets in the complex plane. This improves a recent result of
Aptekarev-Kalyagin-Saff where a formal connection with Nikishin systems was
obtained in the case when $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}|a_n-a|<\infty$ for some $a>0$.
  An important tool in this paper is the study of ""Riemann-Hilbert minors"", or
equivalently, the ""generalized eigenvalues"" of the Hessenberg matrix $H$. We
prove interlacing relations for the generalized eigenvalues by using totally
positive matrices. In the case of asymptotically periodic coefficients $a_n$,
we find weak and ratio asymptotics for the Riemann-Hilbert minors and we obtain
a connection with a vector equilibrium problem. We anticipate that in the
future, the study of Riemann-Hilbert minors may prove useful for more general
classes of multiple orthogonal polynomials.

power of such languages: we introduce a suitable measure of expressive power,
and we obtain a complex hierarchy that encompasses all fragments of the

of the usual colouring number, and have since then found important theoretical
and algorithmic applications. In this paper, we dramatically improve upon the
known upper bounds for generalised colouring numbers for graphs excluding a
fixed minor, from the exponential bounds of Grohe et al. to a linear bound for
the $r$-colouring number $\mathrm{col}_r$ and a polynomial bound for the weak
$r$-colouring number $\mathrm{wcol}_r$. In particular, we show that if $G$
excludes $K_t$ as a minor, for some fixed $t\ge4$, then

$\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)\le\binom{r+t-2}{t-2}\cdot(t-3)(2r+1)\in\mathcal{O}(r^{\,t-1})$.
In the case of graphs $G$ of bounded genus $g$, we improve the bounds to

$g=0$, i.e. if $G$ is planar) and

  Communication",,"  Lab-on-chip devices and point-of-care diagnostic chip devices are composed of
many different components such as nanosensors that must be able to communicate
with other components within the device. Molecular communication is a promising
solution for on-chip communication. In particular, kinesin driven microtubule
(MT) motility is an effective means of transferring information particles from
one component to another. However, finding an optimal shape for these channels
can be challenging. In this paper we derive a mathematical optimization model
that can be used to find the optimal channel shape and dimensions for any
transmission period. We derive three specific models for the rectangular
channels, regular polygonal channels, and regular polygonal ring channels. We
show that the optimal channel shapes are the square-shaped channel for the
rectangular channel, and circular-shaped channel for the other classes of
shapes. Finally, we show that among all 2 dimensional shapes the optimal design
choice that maximizes information rate is the circular-shaped channel.

have shown the need to go beyond entanglement when dealing with mixed states.
Various different measures have sprung up in the literature, for a variety of
reasons, to describe bipartite and multipartite quantum correlations; some are
known under the collective name quantum discord. Yet, in the same sprit as the
criteria for entanglement measures, there is no general mechanism that
determines whether a measure of quantum and classical correlations is a proper
measure of correlations. This is partially due to the fact that the answer is a
bit muddy. In this article we attempt tackle this muddy topic by writing down
several criteria for a ""good"" measure of correlations. We breakup our list into
necessary, reasonable, and debatable conditions. We then proceed to prove
several of these conditions for generalized measures of quantum correlations.
However, not all conditions are met by all measures; we show this via several
examples. The reasonable conditions are related to continuity of correlations,
which has not been previously discussed. Continuity is an important quality if
one wants to probe quantum correlations in the laboratory. We show that most
types of quantum discord are continuous but none are continuous with respect to
the measurement basis used for optimization.

  Kalman filtering",,"  We propose a method to account for model error due to unresolved scales in
the context of the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF). The approach
extends to this class of algorithms the deterministic model error formulation
recently explored for variational schemes and extended Kalman filter. The model
error statistic required in the analysis update is estimated using historical
reanalysis increments and a suitable model error evolution law. Two different
versions of the method are described; a time-constant model error treatment
where the same model error statistical description is time-invariant, and a
time-varying treatment where the assumed model error statistics is randomly
sampled at each analysis step. We compare both methods with the standard method
of dealing with model error through inflation and localization, and illustrate
our results with numerical simulations on a low order nonlinear system
exhibiting chaotic dynamics. The results show that the filter skill is
significantly improved through the proposed model error treatments, and that
both methods require far less parameter tuning than the standard approach.
Furthermore, the proposed approach is simple to implement within a pre-existing
ensemble based scheme. The general implications for the use of the proposed
approach in the framework of square-root filters such as the ETKF are also
discussed.

converge but total probability for appearance of this state diverges. Also we
consider such situation, called quantum anti-Hamlet effect, when, by frequent

probability for appearance of this state converges. (By simple analogy we
define quantum anti-Hamlet effect for unstable quantum system too.) Finally, we

likelihood on the constrained parameter space, we develop a pattern
search-based global optimization technique which can optimize any objective

encapsulated bubbles used currently as contrast agents for medical echography,
exhibit complex dynamics under specific acoustic excitations. Nonetheless,
considering their micron size and the complexity of their interaction
phenomenon with ultrasound waves, expensive and complex experiments and/or
simulations are required for their analysis. The behavior of a microbubble
along its equator can be linked to a system of coupled oscillators. In this
study, the oscillatory behavior of a microbubble has been investigated through
an acousto-mechanical analogy based on a ring-shaped chain of coupled pendula.
Observation of parametric vibration modes of the pendula ring excited at
frequencies between $1$ and $5$ Hz is presented. Simulations have been carried
out and show mode mixing phenomena. The relevance of the analogy between a
microbubble and the macroscopic acousto-mechanical setup is discussed and
suggested as an alternative way to investigate the complexity of microbubble
dynamics.

distributed ensemble of quantum dots under strong excitation (full inversion)
conditions. We focus on the similarities and differences between the cases of
random and regular arrangement of the dots and show that there is very little
difference between the evolution of luminescence in these two cases, both for
identical dots and for a realistically inhomogeneously broadened ensemble. This
means that the enhanced emission or superradiance effect is not due to
accidental clustering of pairs of dots. Moreover, we point out that observation
of an enhanced emission under weak excitation does not prove that true
superradiance will develop in a fully inverted system.

to be sensitive to extremely small concentration changes of signaling
molecules. The accuracy of such molecular signaling is ultimately limited by
the counting noise imposed by the thermal diffusion of molecules. Many
macromolecules and organelles transiently bind to molecular motors and are then
actively transported. We here show that a random albeit directed delivery of
signaling molecules to within a typical diffusion distance to the receptor
reduces the correlation time of the counting noise, effecting an improved
sensing precision. The conditions for this active focusing are indeed
compatible with observations in living cells. Our results are relevant for a
better understanding of molecular cellular signaling and the design of novel
diagnostic devices.

nonparametric models. The method is based on estimating equations that are
$U$-statistics in the observations. The $U$-statistics are based on higher
order influence functions that extend ordinary linear influence functions of
the parameter of interest, and represent higher derivatives of this parameter.
For parameters for which the representation cannot be perfect the method leads
to a bias-variance trade-off, and results in estimators that converge at a
slower than $\sqrt n$-rate. In a number of examples the resulting rate can be
shown to be optimal. We are particularly interested in estimating parameters in
models with a nuisance parameter of high dimension or low regularity, where the
parameter of interest cannot be estimated at $\sqrt n$-rate, but we also
consider efficient $\sqrt n$-estimation using novel nonlinear estimators. The
general approach is applied in detail to the example of estimating a mean
response when the response is not always observed.

friendly to nonexpert users. By predefining a set of areas of interest, this
interface can quickly and efficiently create plans that satisfy extended plan
goals in LTL. The interface can also allow users to customize the paths for
this plan by sketching a set of reference trajectories. Given the custom paths
by the user, the LTL specification and the environment, the interface generates
a plan balancing the customized paths and the LTL specifications. We also show
experimental results with the implemented interface.

$cc(G)\leq n $. G. Chen et al. [Discrete Math. 219 (2000), no. 1--3, 17--26;

the same assertion holds for all claw-free graphs. In this paper, using the
celebrated structure theorem of claw-free graphs due to Chudnovsky and Seymour,
we give an affirmative answer to this question for all claw-free graphs with
independence number at least three. In particular, we prove that if $ G $ is a
connected claw-free graph on $ n $ vertices with $ \alpha(G)\geq 3 $, then $
cc(G)\leq n $ and equality holds if and only if $ G $ is either the graph of
icosahedron, or the complement of a graph on $10$ vertices called twister or

It allows an interpretation of higher-order stateful concurrent programs that
is refined and precise: on the one hand it is conservative with respect to
standard Hyland-Ong games when interpreting purely functional programs as
innocent strategies, while on the other hand it is much more expressive. The
interpretation of programs constructs compositionally a representation of their
execution that exhibits causal dependencies and remembers the points of
non-deterministic branching.The construction is in two stages. First, we build
a compact closed category Tcg. It is a variant of Rideau and Winskel's category
CG, with the difference that games and strategies in Tcg are equipped with
symmetry to express that certain events are essentially the same. This is
analogous to the underlying category of AJM games enriching simple games with
an equivalence relations on plays. Building on this category, we construct the
cartesian closed category Cho as having as objects the standard arenas of
Hyland-Ong games, with strategies, represented by certain events structures,
playing on games with symmetry obtained as expanded forms of these arenas.To
illustrate and give an operational light on these constructions, we interpret
(a close variant of) Idealized Parallel Algol in Cho.

  breaking",,"  In this work we strictly and accurately (within standard quantum mechanical
formalism) consider quantum dynamical interaction between single photon and
photographic plate in case when before this interaction photon trajectories are
not detected (when photographic plate detects interference patterns) as well as
in case when before this interaction photon trajectories are detected in
general case (when photographic plate effectively detects absence of the
interference patterns). (We consider real experiment with Hong-Ou-Mandel
superposition of two-photons where second photon can be considered as the micro
detector of the first photon trajectories.) Also we shall use model of the
collapse by spontaneous (non-dynamical) unitary symmetry (superposition)
breaking (effective hiding) by quantum-classical continuous phase transition.
(Practically, collapse can be considered as an especial case of the general
formalism of spontaneous symmetry breaking that can be successfully applied in
many different domains of the physics, e.g. in elasticity of rigid bodies,
quantum theory of ferromagnetism, quantum theory of electro-weak interactions
as well as in chaotic inflation cosmology.) All this is in full agreement with
existing experimental facts. More over it admits existence of the entanglement
between photon and detector (Schr\""odinger cat effect) which clearly
demonstrates that detection procedure (collapse) has no any absolute character.
In this way it admits a simple solution of the quantum mechanics foundation
problem.

random i.i.d., N( 0,1) entries, and use it to show that $\alpha (d)$ decreases
monotonically with $d$ to the limit given by the Marchenko-Pastur
distribution.\ The monotonicity of $\alpha (d)$ has been recently conjectured
by Bandeira, Kennedy and Singer in their study of the Little Grothendieck
problem over the unitary group $\mathcal{U}_{d}$ \cite{BKS}, a combinatorial
optimization problem. The result implies sharp global estimates for $\alpha
(d)$, new bounds for the expected minimum and maximum singular values, and a
lower bound for the ratio of the expected maximum and the expected minimum
singular value. The proof is based on a connection with the theory of Tur\'{a}n
determinants of orthogonal polynomials. We also discuss some applications to
the problem that originally motivated the conjecture.

  Jammer Selection -- Secure DoF and Jammer Scaling Law",,"  In this paper, we propose opportunistic jammer selection in a wireless
security system for increasing the secure degrees of freedom (DoF) between a
transmitter and a legitimate receiver (say, Alice and Bob). There is a jammer
group consisting of $S$ jammers among which Bob selects $K$ jammers. The
selected jammers transmit independent and identically distributed Gaussian
signals to hinder the eavesdropper (Eve). Since the channels of Bob and Eve are
independent, we can select the jammers whose jamming channels are aligned at
Bob, but not at Eve. As a result, Eve cannot obtain any DoF unless it has more
than $KN_j$ receive antennas, where $N_j$ is the number of jammer's transmit
antenna each, and hence $KN_j$ can be regarded as defensible dimensions against
Eve. For the jamming signal alignment at Bob, we propose two opportunistic
jammer selection schemes and find the scaling law of the required number of
jammers for target secure DoF by a geometrical interpretation of the received
signals.

sputtering, which involve dual beam setups, sequential application of ion beams
from different directions, or sample rotation, are studied with the method of
kinetic Monte Carlo simulation of ion beam erosion and surface diffusion. In
this work, we only consider erosion dominated situations. The results are
discussed by comparing them to a number of theoretical propositions and to
experimental findings. Two ion-beams aligned opposite to each other produce
stationary, symmetric ripples. Two ion beams crossing at right angle will
produce square patterns only, if they are exactly balanced. In all other cases
of crossed beams, ripple patterns are created, and their orientations are shown
to be predictable from linear continuum theory. In sequential ion beam
sputtering we find a very rapid destruction of structures created from the
previous beam direction after a rotation step, which leads to a transient
decrease of overall roughness. Superpositions of patterns from several rotation
steps are difficult to obtain, as they exist only in very short time windows.
In setups with a single beam directed towards a rotating sample, we find a
non-monotonic dependence of roughness on rotation frequency, with a very
pronounced minimum appearing at the frequency scale set by the relaxation of
prestructures observed in sequential ion beam setups. Furthermore we find that
the logarithm of the height of structures decreases proportional to the inverse
frequency.

processors that arises in large-scale parallel computations. When tasks are
monotonic, the best known result is a $(\frac{3}{2}+\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for makespan minimization with a complexity linear in $n$ and
polynomial in $\log{m}$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ where $\epsilon$ is
arbitrarily small. We propose a new perspective of the existing speedup models:
the speedup of a task $T_{j}$ is linear when the number $p$ of assigned
processors is small (up to a threshold $\delta_{j}$) while it presents
monotonicity when $p$ ranges in $[\delta_{j}, k_{j}]$; the bound $k_{j}$
indicates an unacceptable overhead when parallelizing on too many processors.
The generality of this model is proved to be between the classic monotonic and
linear-speedup models. For any given integer $\delta\geq 5$, let $u=\left\lceil
\sqrt[2]{\delta} \right\rceil-1\geq 2$. In this paper, we propose a
$\frac{1}{\theta(\delta)} (1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for makespan
minimization where $\theta(\delta) = \frac{u+1}{u+2}\left( 1- \frac{k}{m}
\right)$ ($m\gg k$). As a by-product, we also propose a
$\theta(\delta)$-approximation algorithm for throughput maximization with a
common deadline.

polar and polarizable molecules with collinear electric fields lead to a sui
generis topology of the corresponding Stark energy surfaces and of other
observables - such as alignment and orientation cosines - in the plane spanned

loci of the intersections of the surfaces can be traced analytically and that
the eigenstates as well as the number of their intersections can be
characterized by a single integer index. The value of the index, distinctive
for a particular ratio of the interaction parameters, brings out a close
kinship with the eigenproperties obtained previously for a class of Stark
states via the apparatus of supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

as a broadband coherent perfect absorber (CPA) when symmetrically illuminated
by two counter-propagating incident waves. A theoretical analysis based on wave
interference and results of numerical simulations of the proposed metasurface

the terahertz regime by using a time-domain spectroscopy technique. We observe
that the metasurface can work as a CPA below its lowest diffraction frequency.
The size of the absorptive areas of the proposed CPA can be much smaller than
the incident wavelength. Unlike conventional CPAs, the presented one
simultaneously achieves the broadband operation and energy concentration of
electromagnetic waves at the deep-subwavelength scale.

  First, we define unital cyclic twisted $A_\infty$ algebras and prove some
basic results about them, including a homological perturbation lemma which
allows one to construct minimal models of such algebras. We then construct an
equivariant extension of $A_\infty$ algebras which are invariant under a torus
action on the underlying complex. Finally, we construct a homotopy retraction
of the Cartan-Weil complex to equivariant cohomology, which allows us to
construct minimal models for equivariant cyclic twisted $A_\infty$ algebras.

if the intersection of any two sets from the collection is the same, and we
call a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$ sunflower-free if it contains no
sunflowers. Following the recent breakthrough of Ellenberg and Gijswijt and
Croot, Lev and Pach we apply the polynomial method directly to
Erd\H{o}s-Szemer\'{e}di sunflower problem and prove that any sunflower-free
family $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ has size at most \[
|\mathcal{F}|\leq3n\sum_{k\leq

a set $A\subset(\mathbb Z/D \mathbb Z)^{n}=\{1,2,\dots,D\}^{n}$ for $D>2$ is
sunflower-free if every distinct triple $x,y,z\in A$ there exists a coordinate
$i$ where exactly two of $x_{i},y_{i},z_{i}$ are equal. Using a version of the
polynomial method with characters
$\chi:\mathbb{Z}/D\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ instead of polynomials, we
show that any sunflower-free set $A\subset(\mathbb Z/D \mathbb Z)^{n}$ has size
\[ |A|\leq c_{D}^{n} \] where $c_{D}=\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}(D-1)^{2/3}$. This can be
seen as making further progress on a possible approach to proving the

behavior that was noticed in coronal X-ray jets observed by Hinode/XRT. A jet
like bundle observed at the limb in Ca II H line appears to show a magnetic
topology that is similar to X-ray jets (i.e., the Eiffel tower shape). The
appearance of such magnetic topology is usually assumed to be caused by
magnetic reconnection near a null point. Transverse motions of the jet axis are
recorded but no clear evidence of twist is appearing from the highly processed
movie. The aim is to investigate the dynamical behavior of an incompressible
magnetic X-point occurring during the magnetic reconnection in the jet
formation region. The viscous effect is specially considered in the closed
line-tied magnetic X-shape nulls. We perform the MHD numerical simulation in
2-D by solving the visco-resistive MHD equations with the tracing of velocity
and magnetic field. A qualitative agreement with Hinode observations is found
for the oscillatory and non-oscillatory behaviors of the observed solar jets in
both the chromosphere and the corona. Our results suggest that the viscous
effect contributes to the excitation of the magnetic reconnection by generating
oscillations that we observed at least inside this Ca II H line cool solar jet
bundle.

generalized Calabi--Yau condition places much stronger constrains: a compact
type one generalized Calabi--Yau fibers over the 2-torus and if the structure
has one compact leaf, then this fibration can be chosen to be the fibration by
the symplectic leaves of the generalized complex structure. If the twisting
class vanishes, one can always deform the structure so that it has a compact

  relations for compact star-forming galaxies at redshifts 0 < z < 3",,"  We study relations between global characteristics of low-redshift (0 < z < 1)
compact star-forming galaxies, including absolute optical magnitudes, Hbeta
emission-line luminosities (or equivalently star-formation rates), stellar
masses, and oxygen abundances. The sample consists of 5182 galaxies with
high-excitation HII regions selected from the SDSS DR7 and SDSS/BOSS DR10
surveys adopting a criterion [OIII]4959/Hbeta > 1. These data were combined
with the corresponding data for high-redshift (2 < z < 3) star-forming
galaxies. We find that in all diagrams low-z and high-z star-forming galaxies
are closely related indicating a very weak dependence of metallicity on stellar
mass, redshift, and star-formation rate. This finding argues in favour of the
universal character of the global relations for compact star-forming galaxies
with high-excitation HII regions over redshifts 0 < z < 3.

bounds on the optimum of a bounded integer program. These bounds are
constructed using lex maximal and minimal feasible points taken under different
permutations. Their strength is analyzed and it is shown that a family of
primal bounds is tight for any $0\backslash 1$ program with nonnegative linear
objective, and a different family of dual bounds is tight for any packing- or
covering-type $0\backslash 1$ program with an arbitrary linear objective. The
former result yields a structural characterization for the optimum of
$0\backslash 1$ programs, with connections to matroid optimization, and a
heuristic for general integer programs. The latter result implies a stronger
polyhedral representation for the integer feasible points and a new approach
for deriving strong valid inequalities to the integer hull. Since the
construction of our bounds depends on the computation of lex optima, we derive
explicit formulae for lex optima of some special polytopes, such as polytopes
that are monotone with respect to each variable, and integral polymatroids and
their base polytopes. We also classify $\mathrm{P}$ and
$\mathrm{NP}$-$\mathrm{hard}$ cases of computing lex bounds and lex optima.

the power spectrum which was finite in Krein space quantization and the
trans-Plankian corrections due to the exited modes were non-linear. It was
shown that the de Sitter limit of corrections reduces to what obtained via the
several previous conventional methods, moreover, with such modes the space-time
symmetry becomes manifest. In this paper, inspired by Krein method and using
exited-de Sitter modes as the fundamental initial states during the inflation,
we calculate particle creation in the spatially flat Robertson-Walker
space-time. It is shown that in de Sitter and Minkowski space-time in the far
past time limit, our results coincides to the standard results.

recent years due to their fascinating optoelectronic properties. Dielectric
property of MoS2 is desired for the optoelectronic application. In this paper,
terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy and ellipsometry technology are
employed to investigate the dielectric response of MoS2 crystal in THz and
visible region. The real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric constant
of MoS2 crystal are found to follow a Drude model in THz region, which is due
to the intrinsic carrier absorption. In visible region, the general trend of
the complex dielectric constant is found to be described with a Lorentz model,
while two remarkable peaks are observed at 1.85 and 2.03 eV, which have been
attributed to the splitting arising from the combined effect of interlayer
coupling and spin-orbit coupling. This work affords the fundamental dielectric
data for the future optoelectronic applications with MoS2.

  Systems with Thermal Fluctuations",,"  In microscopic mechanical systems interactions between elastic structures are
often mediated by the hydrodynamics of a solvent fluid. At microscopic scales
the elastic structures are also subject to thermal fluctuations. Stochastic
numerical methods are developed based on multigrid which allow for the
efficient computation of both the hydrodynamic interactions in the presence of
walls and the thermal fluctuations. The presented stochastic multigrid approach
provides efficient real-space numerical methods for generating the required
stochastic driving fields with long-range correlations consistent with
statistical mechanics. The presented approach also allows for the use of
spatially adaptive meshes in resolving the hydrodynamic interactions. Numerical
results are presented which show the methods perform in practice with a
computational complexity of O(N log(N)).

  Introduction",,"  We review the fundamental properties of the quantum relative entropy for
finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In particular, we focus on several
inequalities that are related to the second law of thermodynamics, where the
positivity and the monotonicity of the quantum relative entropy play key roles;
these properties are directly applicable to derivations of the second law
(e.g., the Clausius inequality). Moreover, the positivity is closely related to
the quantum fluctuation theorem, while the monotonicity leads to a quantum
version of the Hatano-Sasa inequality for nonequilibrium steady states. Based
on the monotonicity, we also discuss the data processing inequality for the
quantum mutual information, which has a similar mathematical structure to that
of the second law. Moreover, we derive a generalized second law with quantum
feedback control. In addition, we review a proof of the monotonicity in line
with Petz.

semiconductors, have drawn great interests due to their potential applications
in viable photonic and optoelectronic devices, such as saturable absorbers
(SAs) and optical switches, etc. In this work, tungsten disulfide (WS2) based
SA for ultrafast photonic applications was demonstrated. WS2 nanosheets were
prepared using liquid-phase exfoliation method and embedded in polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) thin film for the practical usage. Saturable absorption was
observed in the WS2-PVA SA at the telecommunication waveband near 1550 nm. By
incorporating WS2-PVA SA into a fiber laser cavity, both stable mode locking
operation and Q-switching operation were achieved. In the mode locking
operation, the laser obtained femtosecond output pulse width and high spectral
purity in the radio frequency spectrum. In the Q-switching operation, the laser
had tunable repetition rate and output pulse energy of a few tens of nano
joule. Our findings suggest that few-layer WS2 nanosheets embedded in PVA thin
film are promising nonlinear optical materials for ultrafast photonic
applications as a mode locker or Q-switcher.

reduction of the point set information to its angular component relative to a

spacings of these angular components, which can for instance beencoded as a
density function on $\Real_{+}$. In fact, this \emph{radial projection} method
is not entirely new, andthe most natural choice of a point set, the integer

been operational continuously for 18 months and the change of efficiency is
less than 1%. An analytic model for pulse heigh spectra is described and the

detector optimization is possible through film texture, power size, moderator

correlations and satisfying no-signalling must also violate the assumption that
the model faithfully reproduces the statistical dependences and
independences---a so-called ""fine-tuning"" of the causal parameters; this
includes, in particular, retrocausal explanations of the EPRB correlations. I
consider this analysis with a view to enumerating the possible responses an
advocate of retrocausal explanations might propose. I focus on the response of
N\""{a}ger (2015), who argues that the central ideas of causal explanations can
be saved if one accepts the possibility of a stable fine-tuning of the causal
parameters. I argue that, in light of this view, a violation of faithfulness
does not necessarily rule out retrocausal explanations of the EPRB
correlations, although it certainly constrains such explanations. I conclude by
considering some possible consequences of this type of response for retrocausal
explanations.

societies will show faster adoption and cessation of smoking. Evidence from a
new century-long composite data set on smoking prevalence in 25 countries
supports the model, with direct implications for public health interventions
around the world. Our results suggest that differences in culture between
societies can measurably affect the temporal dynamics of a social spreading
process, and that these effects can be understood via a quantitative

probe beam, and appropriate local operations via classical feed-forward, one
can obtain the desired states in a nearly deterministic way. Another scheme is
an analyzer for multiphoton maximally entangled states, which is taken as a
further application of the above entangler. In this scheme, all of the $2^n$

Furthermore, an efficient two-step nondestructive Bell-state analyzer is

recurrence, which generalizes a theorem of Bergelson and Tao proved for
ultraproducts of finite groups. Moreover, a quantitative version of our proof
gives that $\varepsilon$-approximate mixing implies
$3\sqrt{\varepsilon}$-approximate double recurrence. Examples of approximately
mixing probability groups are quasirandom groups introduced by Gowers, so the
last theorem generalizes and sharpens the corresponding results for quasirandom

the fact that the ultraproduct of locally compact unimodular amenable groups is
a probability group provides a general alternative to Furstenberg

HI content of a galaxy varies with various global galaxian properties. There is
a clear trend of increasing gas mass fraction with decreasing metallicity, mass
and luminosity. We obtain the relation M(HI)/L(g)~L(g)^{-0.3}, in agreement

median gas mass fraction f(gas) for the GBT sample is equal to 0.94 while the
mean gas mass fraction is 0.90+/-0.15, with a lower limit of ~0.65. The HI
depletion time is independent of metallicity, with a large scatter around the
median value of 3.4 Gyr. The ratio of the baryonic mass to the dynamical mass
of the metal-deficient BCDs varies from 0.05 to 0.80, with a median value of
~0.2. About 65% of the BCDs in our sample have an effective yield larger than
the true yield, implying that the neutral gas envelope in BCDs is more
metal-deficient by a factor of 1.5-20, as compared to the ionized gas.

  Lattice",,"  Two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators (TIs), also known as quantum spin
Hall (QSH) insulators, are excellent candidates for coherent spin transport
related applications because the edge states of 2D TIs are robust against
nonmagnetic impurities since the only available backscattering channel is
forbidden. Currently, most known 2D TIs are based on a hexagonal (specifically,
honeycomb) lattice. Here, we propose that there exists the quantum spin Hall
effect (QSHE) in a buckled square lattice. Through performing global structure
optimization, we predict a new three-layer quasi-2D (Q2D) structure which has
the lowest energy among all structures with the thickness less than 6.0 {\AA}
for the BiF system. It is identified to be a Q2D TI with a large band gap (0.69
eV). The electronic states of the Q2D BiF system near the Fermi level are
mainly contributed by the middle Bi square lattice, which are sandwiched by two
inert BiF2 layers. This is beneficial since the interaction between a substrate
and the Q2D material may not change the topological properties of the system,
as we demonstrate in the case of the NaF substrate. Finally, we come up with a
new tight-binding model for a two-orbital system with the buckled square
lattice to explain the low-energy physics of the Q2D BiF material. Our study
not only predicts a QSH insulator for realistic room temperature applications,
but also provides a new lattice system for engineering topological states such
as quantum anomalous Hall effect.

method is based on the fractal-cluster relations of V.P. Burdakov and the
analytical apparatus of the thermodynamics of I. Prigozhin's structure. This
theory consists of two parts: deterministic and probabilistic. The first part
includes the static and dynamic criteria, the fractal-cluster dynamic equations
which are based on the Fibonacci's range characteristics fractal-cluster
correlations. The second part includes fundamentals of the probabilistic theory
of a fractal-cluster systems. This part includes the dynamic equations of the
probabilistic evolution of these systems. By using the numerical researches of
these equations for the stationary case the random state field of the one in
the phase space of the $D$, $H$, $F$ criteria have been obtained. For the
socio-economical and biological systems this theory has been tested. In
particular, three fundamental fractal-cluster laws have been obtained for
biological organisms: probabilistic, energetic and evolutionary.

dimension of the set of directions in a rational billiard having fast
recurrence, which corresponds to a dynamical version of a classical result of
Jarn\'ik and Besicovich. Our main tool are planar resonant sets arising from a
given translation surface, that is the countable set of directions of its
saddle connections or of its closed geodesics, filtered according to length. In
an abstract setting, and assuming specific metric properties on a general
planar resonant set, we prove a dichotomy for the Hausdorff measure of the set
of directions which are well approximable by directions in the resonant set,
and we give an estimate on the dimension of the set of badly approximable
directions. Then we prove that the resonant sets arising from a translation
surface satisfy the required metric properties.

monitor complex natural phenomena. Recent research works have intensively
studied distributed optimization problems in the case where the nodes have to
estimate a single optimum parameter vector collaboratively. However, there are
many important applications that are multitask-oriented in the sense that there
are multiple optimum parameter vectors to be inferred simultaneously, in a
collaborative manner, over the area covered by the network. In this paper, we
employ diffusion strategies to develop distributed algorithms that address
multitask problems by minimizing an appropriate mean-square error criterion
with $\ell_2$-regularization. The stability and convergence of the algorithm in
the mean and in the mean-square sense is analyzed. Simulations are conducted to
verify the theoretical findings, and to illustrate how the distributed strategy
can be used in several useful applications related to spectral sensing, target
localization, and hyperspectral data unmixing.

traditionally operated under at least one of two central assumptions: the
constraints are derived from a utility function and/or the multivariate
probability distribution of the underlying asset returns is fully known. In
practice, both the performance criteria and the informational structure are
markedly different: risk-taking agents are mandated to build portfolios by
primarily constraining the tails of the portfolio return to satisfy VaR, stress
testing, or expected shortfall (CVaR) conditions, and are largely ignorant
about the remaining properties of the probability distributions. As an
alternative, we derive the shape of portfolio distributions which have maximum
entropy subject to real-world left-tail constraints and other expectations. Two
consequences are (i) the left-tail constraints are sufficiently powerful to
overide other considerations in the conventional theory, rendering individual
portfolio components of limited relevance; and (ii) the ""barbell"" payoff
(maximal certainty/low risk on one side, maximum uncertainty on the other)
emerges naturally from this construction.

dimensional simplified Ericksen--Leslie system modelling the incompressible
nematic liquid crystal flows. The hydrodynamic system consists of the
Navier--Stokes equations for the fluid velocity coupled with a convective
Ginzburg--Landau type equation for the averaged molecular orientation. The
fluid velocity is assumed to satisfy a no-slip boundary condition, while the
molecular orientation is subject to a time-dependent Dirichlet boundary
condition that corresponds to the strong anchoring condition for liquid
crystals. We first establish the existence of optimal boundary controls. Then
we show that the control-to-state operator is Fr\'echet differentiable between
appropriate Banach spaces and derive first-order necessary optimality
conditions in terms of a variational inequality involving the adjoint state
variables.

holographic Schwinger effect with a rotating probe D3-brane. We discover that
for the zero temperature case in the Schwinger effect, the faster the angular
velocity and the farther the distance of the test particle pair at D3-brane,
the potential barrier of total potential energy also grows higher and wider.
This paper shows that at a finite temperature, when $S^5$ without rotation is
close to the horizon, the Schwinger effect fails because the particles remain
in an annihilate state, which is an absolute vacuum state. However, the angular
velocity in $S^5$ will avoid the existence of an absolute vacuum near the
horizon. For both zero and finite temperature states, the achieved results
completely agree with the results of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action. So the
theories in this paper are consistent. All of these show that these theories
will play important roles in future pair production research.

(EPRL) spinfoam model is derived by employing the theory of unitary
representation of SL(2,$\mathbb{C}$). The path integral representation is taken
as a starting point of semiclassical analysis. The relation between the
spinfoam model and classical simplicial geometry is studied via the large spin
asymptotic expansion of the spinfoam amplitude with all spins uniformaly large.
More precisely in the large spin regime, there is an equivalence between the
spinfoam critical configuration (with certain nondegeneracy assumption) and a
classical Lorentzian simplicial geometry. Such an equivalence relation allows
us to classify the spinfoam critical configurations by their geometrical
interpretations, via two types of solution-generating maps. The equivalence
between spinfoam critical configuration and simplical geometry also allows us
to define the notion of globally oriented and time-oriented spinfoam critical
configuration. It is shown that only at the globally oriented and time-oriented
spinfoam critical configuration, the leading order contribution of spinfoam
large spin asymptotics gives precisely an exponential of Lorentzian Regge
action of General Relativity. At all other (unphysical) critical
configurations, spinfoam large spin asymptotics modifies the Regge action at
the leading order approximation.

  on-chip resonant four-wave mixing",,"  We propose and demonstrate localized mode coupling as a viable dispersion
engineering technique for phase-matched resonant four-wave mixing (FWM). We
demonstrate a dual-cavity resonant structure that employs coupling-induced
frequency splitting at one of three resonances to compensate for cavity
dispersion, enabling phase-matching. Coupling strength is controlled by thermal
tuning of one cavity enabling active control of the resonant
frequency-matching. In a fabricated silicon microresonator, we show an 8 dB
enhancement of seeded FWM efficiency over the non-compensated state. The
measured four-wave mixing has a peak wavelength conversion efficiency of -37.9
dB across a free spectral range (FSR) of 3.334 THz ($\sim$27 nm). Enabled by
strong counteraction of dispersion, this FSR is, to our knowledge, the largest
in silicon to demonstrate FWM to date. This form of mode-coupling-based, active
dispersion compensation can be beneficial for many FWM-based devices including
wavelength converters, parametric amplifiers, and widely detuned correlated
photon-pair sources. Apart from compensating intrinsic dispersion, the proposed
mechanism can alternatively be utilized in an otherwise dispersionless
resonator to counteract the detuning effect of self- and cross-phase modulation
on the pump resonance during FWM, thereby addressing a fundamental issue in the
performance of light sources such as broadband optical frequency combs.

  flows",,"  We consider the flow of a Newtonian fluid in a three-dimensional domain,
rotating about a vertical axis and driven by a vertically invariant horizontal
body-force. This system admits vertically invariant solutions that satisfy the
2D Navier-Stokes equation. At high Reynolds number and without global rotation,
such solutions are usually unstable to three-dimensional perturbations. By
contrast, for strong enough global rotation, we prove rigorously that the 2D
(and possibly turbulent) solutions are stable to vertically dependent
perturbations: the flow becomes 2D in the long-time limit.
  These results shed some light on several fundamental questions of rotating
turbulence: for arbitrary Reynolds number and small enough Rossby number, the
system is attracted towards purely 2D flow solutions, which display no energy
dissipation anomaly and no cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry. Finally, these
results challenge the applicability of wave turbulence theory to describe
stationary rotating turbulence in bounded domains.

determined effectively. In the present paper, we extend these results to
integral domains $A$ that are not necessarily integrally closed.

constructions often come from variations of the concept of tilting, the
vertices of the exchange graph being torsion pairs, t-structures, silting
objects, support $\tau$-tilting modules and so on. All these exchange graphs
stemming from representation theory have the additional feature that they are
the Hasse quiver of a partial order which is naturally defined for the objects.

algorithm requires at most O(n^2/log(n)) iterations to reach stabilization.
This in particular shows that the previously best, trivial upper bound of
O(n^2) is asymptotically not tight. In the logic setting, this translates to
the statement that if two graphs of size n can be distinguished by a formula in
first-order logic with counting with 3 variables (i.e., in C3), then they can
also be distinguished by a C3-formula that has quantifier depth at most
O(n^2/log(n)).
  To prove the result we define a game between two players that enables us to
decouple the causal dependencies between the processes happening simultaneously
over several iterations of the algorithm. This allows us to treat large color
classes and small color classes separately. As part of our proof we show that
for graphs with bounded color class size, the number of iterations until
stabilization is at most linear in the number of vertices. This also yields a
corresponding statement in first-order logic with counting.
  Similar results can be obtained for the respective logic without counting
quantifiers, i.e., for the logic L3.

each odd integer class number set. Odd integer class number set is introduced
in this paper. Since the Lagarias criterion holds for the first subset
regarding computer aided computations, we do prove it using both Lagarias and
Robin's criteria for the second and third subsets and mathematical arguments
accompanied by a large volume of computer language programs. It then follows
that Riemann hypothesis holds as well.

  heterostructures",,"  Spin-conserving and spin-flip opaque reflections of electrons from a
potential barrier in heterostructures are described. An electric field of the
barrier is considered to be the only source of energy spin splitting in the
presence of spin-orbit interaction and its form is calculated in the
three-level {\kp} model for a nontrival case of unbound electrons. Reflection
angles and amplitudes are calculated for oblique incoming directions. It is
shown that the system can serve as a source or filter of spin-polarized
electron beams. Two unexpected possibilities are pointed out: a) non attenuated
electron propagation in the barrier whose height exceeds the energies of
incoming electrons, b) total reflection of electrons whose energies exceed
barrier's height.

dynamics of Earth around the Sun in analysis of its position on 13 April 2029
close to asteroid Apophis which is supposed to be moving in fly-by near the
Earth on its orbit. As of now, we can be sure that trajectory of Apophis is
well-known with respect to the center of Sun. Also, NASA experts calculated
that relative distance between center of Earth and Apophis should be less than
38 thousands of kilometers during closest Apophis approach to the Earth. But
the reasonable question is: will the center of Earth be at the predicted
position at the beginning of April 2029? The matter is that NASA solving
procedure disregards influence of Milankovich cycles to the orbit of Earth but
alternative concept suggests another solution (with additional quasi-periodic
deviation from their solution, proportional to square of eccentricity of Earth
orbit around the Sun equals to ~ 0.017). So, possible perturbation of Earth
orbit is likely to be proportional to (0.017)$^2$ ~ 0.03% from 1 a.e. or ~ 43
200 km which could be compared with gap between Earth and Apophis during
closest Apophis approach to Earth in April 2029.

subspaces containing the ""large"" solutions, obtained jointly with Roberto
Ferretti, and sketch the proof of the latter. Further, we prove a new gap
principle to handle the ""small"" solutions in the system of inequalities
considered in the Subspace Theorem. Finally, we go into the refinement of the
Subspace Theorem by Faltings and Wuestholz, which states that the system of
inequalities considered has only finitely many solutions outside some
effectively determinable proper linear subspace of the ambient solution space.
Estimating the number of these solutions is still an open problem. We give some
motivation that this problem is very hard.

environmental consciousness. In some cases, people do not know what the right
behaviors are to protect the environment. Game engine has been used in the AEC
industry for visualization. However, it has barely been used in environmental
consciousness education, for example, what operation can reduce building energy
consumption, what items are recyclables. As social psychology studies show that
video game can influence human behavior, a good designed game should provide
the game player with right incentives and guide the users to make wiser choices
for better environmental protection. This paper discussed a method to use
serious game engines to educate the players the right actions that should be
taken under in different scenarios. These actions in real life will results in
a better environmental protection. The game proposed in this study is for
residential home operation. Other scenarios such as restaurant operation,
grocery store operations are discussed as expansion of this study. The game
players points will be calculated based on their performance on different
choices and when they surpass a certain level, different rewards will be gained
in order for them to adjust their current living style. The purpose of the game
is to raise the environmental consciousness among the game players and educate
them the right actions they can make to better protect the environment while
they are spending time on games.

uniform morphism, or closely related to one. For example, the lexicographically
least $7/4$-power-free word is a fixed point of a $50847$-uniform morphism. We
identify the structure of the lexicographically least $a/b$-power-free word for
three infinite families of rationals $a/b$ as well many ""sporadic"" rationals
that do not seem to belong to general families. To accomplish this, we develop
an automated procedure for proving $a/b$-power-freeness for morphisms of a
certain form, both for explicit and symbolic rational numbers $a/b$. Finally,
we establish a connection to words on a finite alphabet. Namely, the
lexicographically least $27/23$-power-free word is in fact a word on the finite
alphabet $\{0, 1, 2\}$, and its sequence of letters is $353$-automatic.

  Estimation",,"  We analyze the performance of a linear-equality-constrained least-squares
(CLS) algorithm and its relaxed version, called rCLS, that is obtained via the
method of weighting. The rCLS algorithm solves an unconstrained least-squares
problem that is augmented by incorporating a weighted form of the linear
constraints. As a result, unlike the CLS algorithm, the rCLS algorithm is
amenable to our approach to performance analysis presented here, which is akin
to the energy-conservation-based methodology. Therefore, we initially inspect
the convergence properties and evaluate the precision of estimation as well as
satisfaction of the constraints for the rCLS algorithm in both mean and
mean-square senses. Afterwards, we examine the performance of the CLS algorithm
by evaluating the limiting performance of the rCLS algorithm as the relaxation
parameter (weight) approaches infinity. Numerical examples verify the accuracy
of the theoretical findings.

introduced by elaborating on a simple application in the context of wireless
communications, notably the power control in an interference channel (IC) with

A well-known result of H. Ki and T. Linton is that $\mathscr{N}(b)$ is
$\boldsymbol{\Pi}^0_3$-complete. We show that the set $\mathscr{N}(b)$ of reals
which preserve $\mathscr{N}(b)$ under addition is also
$\boldsymbol{\Pi}^0_3$-complete. We use the characteriztion of $\mathscr{N}(b)$
given by G. Rauzy in terms of an entropy-like quantity called the noise. It
follows from our results that no further characteriztion theorems could result
in a still better bound on the complexity of $\mathscr{N}(b)$. We compute the
exact descriptive complexity of other naturally occurring sets associated with
noise. One of these is complete at the $\boldsymbol{\Pi}^0_4$ level. Finally,
we get upper and lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of the level sets
associated with the noise.

Kummer extension is a ball quotient. We extend our considerations to the
so-called $d$-configurations of curves on the projective plane and we show that
in most cases for a given configuration the associated desingularization of the
Kummer extension is not a ball quotient. Moreover, we provide improved versions
of Hirzebruch-type inequality for $d$-configurations. Finally, we show that the
so-called characteristic numbers (or $\gamma$ numbers) for $d$-configurations
are bounded from above by $8/3$. At the end of the paper we give some examples
of surfaces constructed via Kummer extensions branched along conic
configurations.

of Armstrong (recently verified by Johnson) that the finitely many simultaneous
$(s,t)$-cores have average size $\frac{1}{24}(s-1)(t-1)(s+t+1)$, and that the
subset of self-conjugate cores has the same average (first shown by
Chen--Huang--Wang). We similarly prove a recent conjecture of Fayers that the
average weighted by an inverse stabilizer---giving the ""expected size of the
$t$-core of a random $s$-core""---is $\frac{1}{24}(s-1)(t^2-1)$. We also prove
Fayers' conjecture that the analogous self-conjugate average is the same if $t$
is odd, but instead $\frac{1}{24}(s-1)(t^2+2)$ if $t$ is even. In principle,
our explicit methods---or implicit variants thereof---extend to averages of
arbitrary powers.
  The main new observation is that the stabilizers appearing in Fayers'
conjectures have simple formulas in Johnson's $z$-coordinates parameterization
of $(s,t)$-cores.
  We also observe that the $z$-coordinates extend to parameterize general
$t$-cores. As an example application with $t := s+d$, we count the number of
$(s,s+d,s+2d)$-cores for coprime $s,d\ge1$, verifying a recent conjecture of
Amdeberhan and Leven.

protocol has been proposed for the purpose of removing the detector side
channel attacks. Due to the multi-photon events of coherent states sources,
real-life implementations of MDI-QKD protocol must employ decoy states to beat
the photon-number-splitting attack. Decoy states for MDI-QKD based on the weak
coherent states have been studied recently. In this paper, we propose to
perform MDI-QKD protocol with modified coherent states (MCS) sources. We
simulate the performance of MDI-QKD with the decoy states based on MCS sources.
And our simulation indicates that both the secure-key rate and transmission
distance can be improved evidently with MCS sources.The physics behind this
improvement is that the probability of multi-photon events of the MCS is lower
than that of weak coherent states while at the same time the probability of
single-photon is higher.

theories twisted by flat symplectic vector bundle which encodes the duality
structure of the theory. We describe the scalar-electromagnetic symmetry group
of such models, which consists of flat unbased symplectic automorphisms of the
flat symplectic vector bundle lifting those isometries of the scalar manifold
which preserve the scalar potential. The Dirac quantization condition for such
models involves a local system of integral symplectic spaces, giving rise to a
bundle of polarized Abelian varieties equipped with a symplectic flat
connection, which is defined over the scalar manifold of the theory.
Generalized Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell models arise as the bosonic sector of the
effective theory of string/M-theory compactifications to four-dimensions, and
they are characterized by having non-trivial solutions of ""U-fold"" type.

densities in the Bose-Einstein condensate of a system of hard-core bosons with
nearest neighbor attractive interactions is presented.
  In general, two species of solitons appear: A nonpersistent (NP) type that
fully delocalizes at its maximum speed, and a persistent (P) type that survives
even at its maximum speed, and transforms into a periodic train of solitons
above this speed. When the background condensate density is nonzero, both
species coexist, the soliton is associated with a constant intrinsic frequency,
and its maximum speed is the speed of sound. In contrast, when the background
condensate density is zero, the system has neither a fixed frequency, nor a
speed of sound. Here, the maximum soliton speed depends on the frequency, which
can be tuned to lead to a cross-over between the NP-type and the P-type at a
certain critical frequency, determined by the energy parameters of the system.
We provide a single functional form for the soliton profile, from which diverse
characteristics for various background densities can be obtained. Using the
mapping to spin systems enables us to characterize the corresponding class of
magnetic solitons in
  Heisenberg spin chains with different types of anisotropy, in a unified
fashion.

isometry $\Phi:\mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R^n$ with small distortion which agrees
with $\phi$ in a neighborhood of $E$ and a Euclidean motion $A:\mathbb R^n\to

map. If $E\subset U$ is compact (with some geometry) and the restriction of
$\phi$ to $E$ is an almost isometry with small distortion, how to decide when

$\phi$ in a neighborhood of $E$ and a Euclidean motion $A:\mathbb R^n\to

switches consisting of $N$ output ports. The shared memory of size $M\geq N$
may have an arbitrary number of input ports. Each packet may be admitted by any
incoming port, but must be destined to a specific output port and each output
port may be used by only one queue. The Longest Queue Drop policy is a natural
online strategy used in directing the packet flow in buffering problems.
According to this policy and assuming unit packet values and cost of
transmission, every incoming packet is accepted, whereas if the shared memory
becomes full, one or more packets belonging to the longest queue are preempted,
in order to make space for the newly arrived packets. It was proved in 2001
[Hahne et al., SPAA '01] that the Longest Queue Drop policy is 2-competitive
and at least $\sqrt{2}$-competitive. It remained an open question whether a
(2-\epsilon) upper bound for the competitive ratio of this policy could be
shown, for any positive constant \epsilon. We show that the Longest Queue Drop
online policy is 1.5-competitive.

not $L^\alpha$-flat, for $\alpha \geq 4$. We further establish that there is a
conservative, ergodic, $\sigma$-finite measure preserving transformation with
simple Lebesgue spectrum. This answer affirmatively a long-standing problem of
Banach from the Scottish book. Consequently, we obtain a positive answer to
Mahler's problem in the class of Newman polynomials, and this allows us also to

Morse boundary, that is constructed with rays that identify the ""hyperbolic

produces a well-defined boundary for any finitely generated group. In the case
of a proper $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space this boundary is the contracting boundary
of Charney and Sultan and in the case of a proper Gromov hyperbolic space this
boundary is the Gromov boundary. We prove three results about the Morse
boundary of Teichm\""uller space. First, we show that the Morse boundary of the
mapping class group of a surface is homeomorphic to the Morse boundary of the
Teichm\""uller space of that surface. Second, using a result of Leininger and
Schleimer, we show that Morse boundaries of Teichm\""uller space can contain
spheres of arbitrarily high dimension. Finally, we show that there is an
injective continuous map of the Morse boundary of Teichm\""uller space into the
Thurston compactification of Teichm\""uller space by projective measured
foliations.

gauges to correct the proof and statement of Lemma 2.10.

a finite group. In a previous work, the authors defined what it means for a
connected reductive $k$-group $G$ to be ""parascopic"" for $(\tilde{G},\Gamma)$.
Roughly, this is a simultaneous generalization of several settings. For
example, $\Gamma$ could act on $\tilde{G}$, and $G$ could be the connected part
of the group of $\Gamma$-fixed points in $\tilde{G}$. Or $G$ could be an
endoscopic group, a pseudo-Levi subgroup, or an isogenous image of $\tilde{G}$.
If $G$ is such a group, and both $\tilde{G}$ and $G$ are $k$-quasisplit, then
we constructed a map $\hat{\mathcal{N}}^{\text{st}}$ from the set of stable
semisimple conjugacy classes in the dual $G^\wedge(k)$ to the set of such
classes in $\tilde{G}^\wedge(k)$. When $k$ is finite, this implies a lifting
from packets of representations of $G(k)$ to those of $\tilde{G}(k)$.
  In order to understand such a lifting better, here we describe two ways in
which $\hat{\mathcal{N}}^{\text{st}}$ can be made more explicit. First, we can
express our map in the general case in terms of simpler cases. We do so by
showing that $\hat{\mathcal{N}}^{\text{st}}$ is compatible with isogenies and
with Weil restriction, and also by expressing it as a composition of simpler
maps. Second, in many cases we can construct an explicit $k$-morphism $\hat N
\colon G^\wedge \longrightarrow \tilde{G}^\wedge$ that agrees with
$\hat{\mathcal{N}}^{\text{st}}$. As a consequence, our lifting of
representations is seen to coincide with Shintani lifting in some important
cases.

those of untreated a-SiO2.The similar changes are found in XPS Si 2p and O 1s
of stishovite compared to those of quartz. This means that the pulsed
ion-implantation induces the local high pressure effect which leads to an
appearance of SiO6-structural units in alpha-SiO2 host, forming
""stishovite-like"" local atomic structure. This process can be described within
electronic bonding transition from the four-fold ""quartz-like"" to six-fold
""stishovite-like"" high-pressure phase in SiO2 host-matrix. It is found that
such octahedral conversion depends on the fluence and starts with doses higher
than D = 3*10^16 cm^-2.

  Real-Time Pricing in a Regional Prosumers' Electricity Network",,"  A linear function submission-based double-auction (LFS-DA) mechanism for a
regional electricity network is proposed in this paper. Each agent in the
network is equipped with a battery and a generator. Each agent simultaneously
becomes a producer and consumer of electricity, i.e., a prosumer and trades
electricity in the regional market at a variable price. In the LFS-DA, each
agent uses linear demand and supply functions when they submit bids and asks to
an auctioneer in the regional market.The LFS-DA can achieve an exact balance
between electricity demand and supply for each time slot throughout the
learning phase and was shown capable of solving the primal problem of
maximizing the social welfare of the network without any central price setter,
e.g., a utility or a large electricity company, in contrast with conventional
real-time pricing (RTP). This paper presents a clarification of the
relationship between the RTP algorithm derived on the basis of a dual
decomposition framework and LFS-DA. Specifically, we proved that the changes in
the price profile of the LFS-DA mechanism are equal to those achieved by the
RTP mechanism derived from the dual decomposition framework except for a
constant factor.

theorems work, but can we generalize deeper parts of model theory? In
particular can we generalize stability enough to generalize [Sh:c, Ch.VI]? We
prove that at least we can characterize the $T$'s which are minimal under
Keisler's order, i.e. such that $\{D:D$ is a regular ultrafilter on $\lambda$

we succeed to connect our investigation with the logic $\mathbb{L}^1_{<

ultrafilters, the iterated ultra-powers by it of those two models are
isomorphic.

However, we show that the general trace-refinement problem is undecidable, even
if the first MDP is a Markov chain. Decidability of those problems was stated
as open in 2008. We further study the decidability and complexity of the

multispectral images. The fusion process is formulated as an inverse problem
whose solution is the target image assumed to live in a much lower dimensional
subspace. A sparse regularization term is carefully designed, relying on a
decomposition of the scene on a set of dictionaries. The dictionary atoms and
the corresponding supports of active coding coefficients are learned from the
observed images. Then, conditionally on these dictionaries and supports, the
fusion problem is solved via alternating optimization with respect to the
target image (using the alternating direction method of multipliers) and the
coding coefficients. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the
proposed algorithm when compared with the state-of-the-art fusion methods.

They have been comprehensively studied by Lynch and Vaandrager for
nondeterministic and timed systems; for B\""{u}chi automata the notion of fair
simulation has been introduced by Henzinger, Kupferman and Rajamani. We
contribute to a generalization of fair simulation in two different directions:
one for nondeterministic tree automata previously studied by Bomhard; and the
other for probabilistic word automata with finite state spaces, both under the
B\""{u}chi acceptance condition. The former nondeterministic definition is
formulated in terms of systems of fixed-point equations, hence is readily
translated to parity games and is then amenable to Jurdzi\'{n}ski's algorithm;
the latter probabilistic definition bears a strong ranking-function flavor.
These two different-looking definitions are derived from one source, namely our
coalgebraic modeling of B\""{u}chi automata. Based on these coalgebraic
observations, we also prove their soundness: a simulation indeed witnesses
language inclusion.

distribution is sharply peaked, and apply results regarding primes in short
intervals. This proves that there are infinitely many primes with more than
twice as many ones than zeros in their binary expansion.

they result from the fact that our coordinate system, namely the galaxy
redshift and the incoming photons' direction, is distorted by inhomogeneities
in our universe. We then discuss the impact of the relativistic effects on the
angular power spectrum and on the two-point correlation function in
configuration space. We show that the latter is very well adapted to isolate
the relativistic effects since it naturally makes use of the symmetries of the
different contributions. In particular, we discuss how the Doppler effect and
the gravitational redshift distortions can be isolated by looking for a dipole
in the cross-correlation function between a bright and a faint population of
galaxies.

quarkonium in the 3S1 color-singlet channel, using the nonrelativistic QCD
(NRQCD) factorization approach. The QCD fragmentation process contains infrared
divergences that produce single and double poles in epsilon in 4-2epsilon
dimensions. We devise subtractions that isolate the pole contributions, which
ultimately are absorbed into long-distance NRQCD matrix elements in the NRQCD
matching procedure. The matching procedure involves two-loop renormalizations
of the NRQCD operators. The subtractions are integrated over the phase space
analytically in 4-2epsilon dimensions, and the remainder is integrated over the
phase-space numerically. We find that the order-v^4 contribution is enhanced
relative to the order-v^0 contribution. However, the order-v^4 contribution is
not important numerically at the current level of precision of
quarkonium-hadroproduction phenomenology. We also estimate the contribution to
hadroproduction from gluon fragmentation into quarkonium in the 3PJ color-octet
channel and find that it is significant in comparison to the complete
next-to-leading-order-in-alpha_s contribution in that channel.

at the shifted Gegenbauer-Gauss points combined with very accurate and stable
numerical quadratures to fully discretize the multiple-phase integral form of
the optimal control problem. The proposed algorithm relies on exploiting the
underlying smoothness properties of the solutions for computing approximate
solutions efficiently. In particular, the method brackets discontinuities and
""points of nonsmoothness"" through a novel local adaptive algorithm, which
achieves a desired accuracy on the discrete dynamical system equations by
adjusting both the mesh size and the degree of the approximating polynomials. A
rigorous error analysis of the developed numerical quadratures is presented.
Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated on three test
examples from the open literature.

the closure of the postcritical set is disjoint from the Julia set; further,
critical points either iterate to an attracting cycle or infinity. For
polynomial skew products, Jonsson (Math. Ann., 1999) established that f is
Axiom A if and only if the closure of the postcritical set is disjoint from the

critical orbits either escape to infinity or accumulate on an attracting set.

Friedman's statistic for comparing $r$ treatments across $n$ trials and the
family of power divergence statistics for goodness-of-fit across $n$ trials and
$r$ classifications, with index parameter $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ (Pearson's
statistic corresponds to $\lambda=1$). We obtain a $O(n^{-1})$ bound for the

studies since it can reveal the intrinsic properties of large and complex
online communities. Despite the plethora of these studies, there is a limited
cover on the properties of the social graph while they evolve over time.
Moreover, due to the extreme size of this social network (millions of nodes,
billions of edges), there is a small subset of possible graph properties that
can be efficiently measured in a reasonable timescale. In this paper we propose
a sampling framework that allows the estimation of graph properties on large
social networks. We apply this framework to a subset of Twitter's social

against each other. This kind of solution is an example of what are known as
""fair division"" solutions--- such solutions involve the preferences of all
parties and are accompanied by rigorous guarantees of a specified well-defined
notion of fairness. In this expository article, we give an introduction to the

  applications to perfect complexes for self-injective algebras",,"  In a k-linear triangulated category (where k is a field) we show that the
existence of Auslander-Reiten triangles implies that objects are determined, up
to shift, by knowing dimensions of homomorphisms between them. In most cases
the objects themselves are distinguished by this information, a conclusion
which was also reached under slightly different hypotheses in a theorem of
Jensen, Su and Zimmermann. The approach is to consider bilinear forms on
Grothendieck groups which are analogous to the Green ring of a finite group.
  We specialize to the category of perfect complexes for a self-injective
algebra, for which the Auslander-Reiten quiver has a known shape. We
characterize the position in the quiver of many kinds of perfect complexes,
including those of lengths 1, 2 and 3, rigid complexes and truncated projective
resolutions. We describe completely the quiver components which contain
projective modules. We obtain relationships between the homology of complexes
at different places in the quiver, deducing that every self-injective algebra

the multiplication map of the bialgebra fulfilling a compatibility condition
with the coalgebra structure and a continuity condition. Two problems
concerning additive deformations are considered. With a deformation theory a
cohomology theory should be developed. Here a variant of the Hochschild
cohomology is used. The main result in the first partad of this paper is the
characterization of the trivial deformations, i.e. deformations generated by a
coboundary. Starting with a Hopf algebra, one would expect the deformed
multiplications to have some analogue of the antipode, which we call deformed
antipodes. We prove, that deformed antipodes always exist, explore their
properties, give a formula to calculate them given the deformation and the
antipode of the original Hopf algebra and show in the cocommutative case, that
each deformation splits into a trivial part and into a part with constant
antipodes.

affecting linking practices and find only partial evidence of league table
ranking affecting network centrality, but find a clear inverse relationship
between the density of links and the geographical distance between

which allows us to argue that real-world factors like geography continue to

in a universe having scale factor that evolves linearly with time. Coulomb
screening affects primordial nucleosynthesis via enhancement of thermonuclear
reaction rates. This enhancement is determined by the solving Poisson equation
within the context of mean field theory (under appropriate conditions during
the primordial nucleosynthesis). Using these results, we claim that the mean
field estimates of coulomb screening hardly affect the predicted element
abundances and nucleosynthesis parameters$, \{\eta_9,\xi_e\}$. The deviations
from mean field estimates are also studied in detail by boosting genuine
screening results with the screening parameter ($\omega_s$). These deviations
show negligible effect on the element abundances and on nucleosynthesis
parameters. This work thus rules out the coulomb screening effects on
primordial nucleosynthesis in slow evolving models and confirms that
constraints in ref.[7] on nucleosynthesis parameters remain unaltered.

estimation for sparse inverse covariance (precision) matrices. The penalty is
responsible for inducing sparsity, and a very common choice is the convex $l_1$
norm. However, the best estimator performance is not always achieved with this
penalty. The most natural sparsity promoting ""norm"" is the non-convex $l_0$
penalty but its lack of convexity has deterred its use in sparse maximum
likelihood estimation. In this paper we consider non-convex $l_0$ penalized
log-likelihood inverse covariance estimation and present a novel cyclic descent
algorithm for its optimization. Convergence to a local minimizer is proved,
which is highly non-trivial, and we demonstrate via simulations the reduced

downlink of cellular networks, at the price of channel state information (CSI)
feedback from the mobiles, sent over the uplink. Thus, it creates a mechanism
that can tradeoff some uplink capacity for increased downlink capacity. In this
work we quantify this tradeoff and study the exchange ratio between the
feedback rate (over the uplink) and the downlink rate. We study both finite and
infinite networks, and show that for high enough (but finite) SNR, the uplink
rate can be exchanged for increased downlink rate with a favorable exchange
ratio. This exchange ratio is an increasing function of the channel coherence
time, and a decreasing function of the number of measured base stations. We
also show that devoting a constant fraction of the uplink to CSI feedback can
increase the downlink multiplexing gain continuously from 0 to 1, in finite
networks. On the other hand, in infinite networks (with infinite connectivity)
our bounds can only show doubly logarithmic scaling of the rate with SNR. The
presented results prove that the adaptation of the feedback rate can control
the balance between the uplink and downlink rates. This capability is very
important in modern cellular networks, where the operators need to respond to
continuously changing user demands.

simultaneous estimation of template and model parameters by optimization of the

The scarcity of certain organ instances or classes can result in biased models that perform poorly on unseen data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel loss function called Combo Loss, which is designed to handle input and output imbalance in multi-organ segmentation tasks.

Combo Loss combines two main components: a class-balanced loss function and a spatially-aware loss function. The class-balanced loss function addresses output imbalance by up-weighting the minority classes, while the spatially-aware loss function addresses input imbalance by penalizing the model for incorrectly segmenting organs that are spatially close to the true positive instances.

The authors evaluate Combo Loss on two publicly available datasets: the Medical Segmentation Decathlon dataset and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. The results show that Combo Loss outperforms state-of-the-art loss functions, including Dice loss and Lovász softmax, in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness to input and output imbalance.

Furthermore, the authors perform a series of ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of the two components of Combo Loss. The results demonstrate that both components contribute to the improved performance, and that the combination of the two components leads to better results than using either component alone.

Traditional methods rely on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) that suffer from limited receptive field and inability to model long-range dependencies. Our proposed method, called Segmenter, leverages the self-attention mechanism of transformers to overcome these limitations and achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

Our experimental results show that Segmenter outperforms FCNs on multiple datasets including Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and CamVid. Specifically, we achieve an increase of +4.3% mIoU on Cityscapes and +5.1% mIoU on CamVid compared to the baseline FCN model. Additionally, we provide extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of SAM and other key components of Segmenter.

Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to assign a semantic label to each pixel in an image. While state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive results using deep learning techniques, they are limited by their reliance on image data alone. We argue that contextual information, such as textual descriptions, object categories, and scene information, can provide valuable cues for improving segmentation accuracy.

Our approach, called Contextual Segmentation Network (CSN), leverages a multimodal fusion framework to integrate image and contextual information in a single neural network. The CSN model consists of three main components: an image encoder, a context encoder, and a fusion module. The image encoder extracts features from the input image using a convolutional neural network (CNN), while the context encoder processes the contextual information using a natural language processing (NLP) technique. The fusion module combines the image and context features using a novel attention mechanism, enabling the model to weigh the importance of different contextual cues for each pixel.

We evaluate the CSN model on several benchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes, and demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art image-based segmentation methods. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual information can improve segmentation accuracy by up to 10% in some cases, especially for objects with similar appearance or in scenes with complex context.

This paper presents a novel approach to synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) image segmentation based on iterative, deep, and unsupervised learning techniques. SAS imaging is widely used in underwater exploration and surveillance, but its low-quality images pose significant challenges for accurate target detection and segmentation. Existing methods rely heavily on manual annotation and domain-specific feature extraction, which are time-consuming, tedious, and suboptimal.

To address these limitations, we propose an iterative, deep, and unsupervised method that leverages recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and clustering algorithms. Our approach consists of two main stages: (1) preliminary feature extraction using a CNN; and (2) iterative clustering and refinement enabled by a self-organizing map (SOM). The CNN extracts high-level features from the input SAS images, while the SOM grouping fosters spatial coherence and facilitates the formation of meaningful clusters. An iterative mechanism integrates the CNN and SOM outputs, allowing the algorithm to adaptively refine its segmentations as more data becomes available.

Our exhaustive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over traditional approaches, achieving an average precision increase of 15% and a mean IoU improvement of 0.3. Additionally, we provide thorough analyses of parameter sensitivity and performance consistency across different scenarios, offering insights into the strengths and limitations of deep, unsupervised SAS image segmentation.

Existing methods for semantic image segmentation rely heavily on deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can be computationally expensive and require large amounts of labeled training data.

In contrast, our proposed method, DSD, leverages the power of similarity learning to improve the efficiency and accuracy of semantic image segmentation. Similarity learning is a technique that learns a similarity metric between images, which can be used for various tasks such as image retrieval, duplicate removal, and object recognition. In the context of semantic image segmentation, similarity learning can be used to identify pixels that belong to the same object or region.

The key idea behind DSD is to distill the similarity knowledge from a pre-trained teacher model into a smaller student model. The teacher model is trained on a large dataset of labeled images, while the student model is trained on a smaller dataset of unlabeled images. By distilling the similarity knowledge from the teacher model, the student model can learn to recognize objects and regions in the image without requiring explicit labels.

We evaluate the performance of DSD on several benchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes. Our results show that DSD outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods, including fully supervised models that require large amounts of labeled data. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of DSD by training the student model on a small dataset of only 1000 images, while still achieving competitive performance.

Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves partitioning an image into its constituent parts or objects. Despite decades of research, existing segmentation methods still suffer from several limitations, including poor performance on complex images, reliance on domain-specific heuristics, and lack of generalizability across different datasets. In this paper, we propose K-Net, a novel deep learning architecture designed to address these challenges and move towards unified image segmentation.

K-Net is built upon a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging knowledge from diverse segmentation modalities to improve overall performance. By modality, we refer to the specific approach or technique used to obtain the image data, such as color, depth, or texture. Traditional segmentation methods typically rely on a single modality, which can lead to suboptimal results when the chosen modality is not well-suited for a particular image. K-Net addresses this limitation by jointly incorporating multiple modalities within a single network, allowing it to adapt to various image types and capture a richer representation of the visual data.

The proposed architecture consists of three primary components: (1) a shared encoder that extracts high-level features from all modalities, (2) a set of modality-specific decoders that refine the feature maps according to their corresponding modalities, and (3) a novel fusion module that combines the outputs from each decoder to produce the final segmentation mask. This design enables K-Net to learn both shared and modality-specific representations, leading to improved accuracy and robustness compared to single-modality approaches.

We evaluate K-Net on several benchmark datasets covering a variety of image types and modalities, including RGB, depth, and multispectral imagery. Our experiments demonstrate that K-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. We also perform ablation studies to analyze the contributions of individual modalities and show that K-Net's ability to leverage diverse information improves its performance on complex scenes with multiple objects or varying illumination conditions.

BAN combines the strengths of transformer and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of semantic segmentation.

The transformer architecture has shown great success in various natural language processing tasks, but its application in computer vision tasks is limited due to its inability to process spatial information. On the other hand, CNNs are well-suited for image processing tasks, but their receptive field is limited, which hinders their ability to capture long-range dependencies.

To address this issue, we propose a bilateral attention mechanism that integrates the strengths of both transformer and CNNs. The bilateral attention mechanism allows the network to attend to both local and global features, enabling it to capture both fine-grained details and long-range dependencies.

The BAN architecture consists of a CNN backbone, a transformer encoder, and a bilateral attention module. The CNN backbone extracts local features, which are then fed into the transformer encoder to capture long-range dependencies. The bilateral attention module is used to combine the local and global features, allowing the network to focus on the most relevant information.

We evaluate the BAN on several benchmark datasets, including Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and CamVid. The results show that BAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, BAN achieves an mIoU of 81.8% on Cityscapes, which is 3.5% higher than the previous state-of-the-art method.

We also conduct several ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilateral attention mechanism. The results show that the bilateral attention mechanism improves the performance of the network by 10.3% compared to using only local or global features.

The proposed method, called Transformer Meets Convolution (TMC), leverages the ability of transformers to capture long-range dependencies and the spatial hierarchical representation capabilities of CNNs.

The TMC model consists of three main components: a transformer encoder, a convolutional encoder, and a bilateral fusion module. The transformer encoder processes the input image as a sequence of patches, allowing it to capture global contextual information at multiple scales. The convolutional encoder is used to extract local features from the image, which are then combined with the transformer output through the bilateral fusion module. The fusion module utilizes a novel attention mechanism that enforces bidirectional communication between the transformer and convolutional feature maps, enabling the model to adaptively weight the importance of different features based on their relevance to each other.

Evaluated on two publicly available datasets, Cityscapes and Mapillary Vistas, TMC demonstrated improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an overall mIoU of 86.2% and 87.5%, respectively. Additionally, extensive ablation studies were conducted to analyze the effectiveness of the individual components and provide insights into the working mechanisms of TMC.

Abstract:

Connectomics, the study of the neural connections within the brain, relies heavily on accurate image segmentation to identify and trace neural fibers. However, current segmentation methods often produce errors, particularly in the presence of complex fiber crossings and other challenging features. To address this challenge, we propose RLCorrector, a novel reinforcement learning-based approach that leverages proofreading techniques to improve the accuracy of connectomics image segmentation.

RLCorrector combines the strengths of deep learning-based segmentation methods with the accuracy and efficiency of proofreading techniques. Our approach consists of two main components: a segmentation model and a proofreader. The segmentation model generates an initial segmentation of the input image, which is then passed through the proofreader. The proofreader uses reinforcement learning to learn a policy that corrects errors in the segmentation, iteratively refining the output until an accurate segmentation is achieved.

We evaluate RLCorrector on several benchmark datasets and compare its performance to state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Our results show that RLCorrector significantly improves upon existing methods, with an average accuracy increase of 15% across all datasets. We also demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to various segmentation tasks, including fiber tract segmentation and synapse detection.

In contrast, weak labels, such as image-level class labels or bounding boxes, are much easier to obtain and can be readily available for vast amounts of data.

To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage framework that first generates a set of candidate polygons using a novel adversarial network, and then refines the polygon boundaries using a context-aware module. The adversarial network is trained to produce polygons that are consistent with the weak labels, while the context-aware module refines the boundaries by taking into account the spatial relationships between neighboring pixels.

The proposed method utilizes the theory of algebraic curves to accurately model and segment the complex boundaries of teeth roots in medical images.

Existing methods for tooth root segmentation suffer from limitations such as low accuracy, sensitivity to noise, and difficulty in handling ambiguous or unclear boundaries. In contrast, our proposed approach leverages the power of polynomial curve fitting to precisely capture the underlying shape and structure of tooth roots, even in the presence of image noise or irregularities.

The proposed method consists of three stages: (1) preprocessing, where the input image is enhanced and filtered to reduce noise and enhance contrast; (2) landmark detection, where strategically located points along the boundary of the tooth root are identified and used as control points for the polynomial curve fit; and (3) segmentation, where the fitted polynomial curve is employed to separate the tooth root from the surrounding tissue.

The performance of our method was evaluated using a dataset of 40 dental cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans, with manual annotations by experts serving as ground truth. Quantitative evaluation metrics included mean absolute error, intersection over union (IoU), and Dice similarity coefficient. Our results demonstrate an average IoU score of 95.6% and an average Dice similarity coefficient of 87.3%, outperforming several state-of-the-art approaches.

Active contours, also known as snakes or active contours, are a popular method for image segmentation and object recognition. They are based on the idea of evolving a contour to minimize an energy functional that incorporates information about the image and the desired boundary. However, traditional active contour methods can be limited by their reliance on hand-crafted features and their inability to handle complex, high-dimensional data.

Our proposed method, DAC-LCDVF, addresses these limitations by combining the power of deep learning with the flexibility of active contours.

The base network generates coarse features, which are then passed through the bifurcated branch to produce fine-grained features. While effective, this approach suffers from several limitations. Firstly, the separate branches result in increased computational complexity, leading to slower processing times. Secondly, the disjoint nature of the branches hinders the sharing of information between different scales, resulting in suboptimal feature extraction.

To overcome these issues, we propose a novel integration mechanism that combines the strengths of FCNs and RNNs within the BiSeNet architecture.

Our method combines classifier prediction confidence and comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve the accuracy of polyp detection.

First, we train multiple deep learning models as base classifiers to predict the presence or absence of polyps in colonoscopy images. We then calculate the prediction confidence of each classifier and use it as a weighting factor to combine their outputs. This ensures that the final prediction is made by combining the predictions from all classifiers while giving more weightage to the ones with higher prediction confidences.

Next, we employ PSO to optimize the hyperparameters of the ensemble model. PSO is a population-based optimization algorithm that simulates the social behavior of bird flocking and fish schooling. It searchs for optimal solutions by iteratively updating the positions of particles in a population, which correspond to the hyperparameters of our model. By using comprehensive learning PSO, we are able to simultaneously optimize both the weights and the biases of the ensemble model.

We evaluate our approach on a benchmark dataset consisting of 1000 high-resolution color images of colonoscopies. The results show that our proposed ensemble learning strategy significantly outperforms any single classifier, achieving an improvement in detection accuracy of up to 23%. Additionally, the visualization of the learned features reveals meaningful patterns in the data that can help doctors and researchers better understand the characteristics of polyps and their precursors.

Background:
Accurate segmentation of biomedical images is crucial for various medical applications, including disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning techniques have shown promising results in image segmentation tasks; however, their performance can be limited by the gap between the training data distribution and real-world scenarios. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in deep models hinders understanding the reasoning behind their predictions.

Objective:
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called FANet (Feedback Attention Network), which incorporates feedback attention mechanisms to improve the accuracy and interpretability of biomedical image segmentation.

Methodology:
FANet consists of two main components: an encoder network and a feedback attention module. The encoder network follows a U-Net architecture with skip connections, designed to capture multi-scale contextual information. The feedback attention module is applied on top of the encoder network, consisting of multiple attention layers that focus on different aspects of the input image. Each attention layer computes spatial attention maps to highlight relevant regions, allowing the model to refine its predictions based on the feedback received from previously generated outputs. We implement a self-gated mechanism that adaptively weights the importance of the attention signals, enabling the model to balance between local and global dependencies. Additionally, we introduce a routing strategy that directs the information flow across different attention layers, facilitating better feature representation and exchange.

Results:
We evaluate our method using four publicly available datasets (Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, CamVid, and MSRA10K) and compare it against state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

Abstract:

Unsupervised medical image segmentation is a fundamental task in medical imaging analysis, which aims to separate different structures or tissues within an image without any prior knowledge of class labels. However, achieving accurate segmentation results remains challenging due to factors such as varying image intensities, artifacts, and subtle boundaries. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach called contrastive registration for unsupervised medical image segmentation. By aligning images with a similarity metric that captures the spatial relationships between pixels, we encourage the model to learn meaningful features that can be used for subsequent segmentation tasks.

The proposed method consists of two main components: (1) contrastive registration, which aligns images by maximizing their similarities while preserving their inherent spatial relationships; and (2) feature learning, where the aligned images are passed through a encoder-decoder architecture to obtain high-level features. These features are then utilized for segmentation using a clustering algorithm. Extensive experiments on various medical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, including traditional registration techniques and deep learning-based segmentation models.

Our key contributions include:

* The introduction of contrastive registration for unsupervised medical image segmentation, which leverages the power of self-similarity to improve feature representation.
* The development of a robust feature learning framework that integrates contrastive registration with a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture.
* Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, highlighting the effectiveness and generalizability of our technique across diverse medical image modalities.

Our approach consists of two stages: 1) pre-training a feature extractor on a large-scale object detection dataset, and 2) fine-tuning the feature extractor on a smaller dataset of images with annotated portion sizes.

We evaluate our approach on several datasets with varying levels of complexity and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods for food portion estimation. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-domain feature adaptation for addressing the challenge of limited annotated data in the target domain. We also perform a thorough analysis of the contribution of different components of our approach, providing insights into the importance of domain adaptation and the choice of feature extractor architecture.

Our work has important implications for the development of automated food portion estimation systems, which can help address issues related to food waste, nutrition, and health. The proposed approach can be applied to a wide range of applications, including food portion estimation in restaurants, cafeterias, and home environments."

Our approach aims to address the challenges of domain shift and data heterogeneity in federated learning, where data from multiple sources is combined to train a shared model.

Existing methods for federated domain generalization rely on domain-invariant feature learning, which can be limited by the quality of the domain augmentations used. In contrast, FedDG uses a different approach based on episodic learning, which has been shown to be effective in domain adaptation.

In FedDG, we first transform the input images into a continuous frequency space using a Fourier transform. We then divide the frequency space into multiple sub-bands, and each client learns a separate model to predict the segmentation mask for each sub-band. The sub-bands are chosen such that they capture the most important frequency information for segmentation.

During training, each client updates its local model using its own data, and the updates are combined across clients using a federated averaging method. In addition, we introduce a novel episodic learning strategy that encourages the clients to learn domain-invariant features. Specifically, we create episodes of segmentation tasks, where each episode consists of a random subset of images from multiple domains. The clients are trained to predict the segmentation masks for each episode, and the episodes are designed to gradually increase in difficulty.

We evaluate FedDG on several medical image segmentation tasks, including brain tumor segmentation, liver segmentation, and lung segmentation. Our results show that FedDG outperforms state-of-the-art federated domain generalization methods, and achieves performance comparable to a centralized model trained on the combined data from all clients.

Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to analyze the effectiveness of the different components of FedDG. The results show that the episodic learning strategy and the continuous frequency space representation are crucial for the performance of FedDG.

Our method, called FedDG-EPS, aims to address the challenges of domain shift and data heterogeneity in distributed medical imaging datasets, where data from different domains may have varying modalities, resolutions, and qualities.

Existing FedDG methods typically operate in the spatial domain, where the model is trained on cropped images or patches without considering the underlying structure of the data. However, these methods are limited by their inability to capture complex patterns and relationships between pixels that exist in the frequency domain. To overcome this limitation, FedDG-EPS exploits the properties of continuous frequency space, allowing the model to learn robust feature representations that are insensitive to domain-specific variations.

The key innovation of FedDG-EPS lies in its ability to perform episode-based training, where each episode consists of a sequence of continuously sampled images from multiple domains. By operating in the frequency domain, our method can effectively decouple the underlying factors of variation across different domains and jointly optimize them with the main task of interest - medical image segmentation. We introduce a novel regularization term that encourages the model to focus on the most informative frequencies, suppressing the impact of irrelevant ones. This allows us to learn a set of domain-invariant features that achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets while significantly reducing the need for annotations.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FedDG-EPS against several baseline methods, including adversarial training anddomain-adaptive pre-training. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of various components and provide insights into the working mechanism of our proposed framework. The results show that FedDG-EPS achieves superior segmentation accuracy compared to other methods, particularly when dealing with unseen domains or limited annotated data.

By integrating these two techniques, we aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of food image segmentation, which is a crucial step in various applications such as nutrition analysis, recipe suggestion, and food recognition.

Label corruption, where the ground truth labels are incorrect or noisy, is a common problem in image segmentation tasks that can significantly degrade the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation models.

Existing approaches to address label corruption typically involve either data preprocessing techniques, such as data augmentation and noise removal, or robust loss functions that can tolerate certain levels of label noise. However, these methods have limitations in terms of their ability to handle severe label corruption or their computational complexity.

In contrast, Co-Seg takes a different approach by leveraging the power of co-segmentation, which involves segmenting the same image multiple times using different modalities or features. By combining the segmentation results from multiple modalities or features, Co-Seg can improve the robustness of the segmentation model to label corruption and achieve better performance.

The key idea behind Co-Seg is to use a combination of modalities or features that are complementary to each other, such that the errors in one modality or feature can be compensated by the others. We propose a novel fusion strategy that combines the segmentation results from multiple modalities or features using a weighted averaging method, where the weights are learned from a small set of clean labels.

We evaluate the performance of Co-Seg on several benchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes, under various label corruption scenarios.

We propose a simple and effective way to perform this knowledge transfer, using a lightweight, learnable linear layer to adapt the features from the pre-trained model to the target task.

We evaluate the performance of NAKT on several medical image segmentation tasks, including brain tumor segmentation, liver segmentation, and lung segmentation.

The goal is to improve the accuracy of deep learning models for segmenting medical images, specifically in cases where there is limited annotated data available for a specific modality or domain.

The proposed method leverages both intra-modal (within modality) and cross-modal (between modalities) semantic consistency to enable effective domain adaptation. It utilizes a contrastive learning framework that encourages the model to learn features that are not only discriminative within a single modality but also consistent across different modalities. Moreover, an adversarial training strategy is employed to ensure that the learned feaures are robust against variations in image intensity and other nuisance variables.

Extensive experiments were conducted on a large dataset of X-ray and CT scans, with results showing significant improvements in segmentation performance compared to conventional domain adaptation methods. Specifically, the proposed method improved Dice similarity coefficient by approximately 10% on average.

This allows us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several challenging datasets without requiring a large amount of training data.

Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to various baselines and prior art methods. We show that our method outperforms others on three different 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks, achieving an average segmentation accuracy of 95% on unseen classes. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to analyze the contribution of individual components of our model, providing insights into the role of each component in improving performance.

Accurate segmentation of medical images is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning in various medical disciplines. However, annotating large amounts of data for deep learning models poses significant challenges. In this work, we propose w-Net, a novel dual supervised medical image segmentation model that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to improve performance while reducing annotation efforts. Our approach combines multi-dimensional attention and cascade multi-scale convolutions to effectively capture spatial hierarchical context and semantics across different scales. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets, including brain tumor, pancreatic cancer, and lung nodule detection, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, when using only 20% of the labeled data, w-Net achieves comparable results to fully supervised models. Furthermore, we show that our model generalizes well to unseen data, outperforming other approaches under limited annotation conditions. This study introduces an effective way to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data for medical image segmentation tasks, paving the road for improving machine learning model performance in healthcare applications."

Unlike traditional active learning methods that rely on uncertainty or random sampling, MetaBox+ uses a priority map to identify regions of the image that are most likely to contain class boundaries, and thus, are most informative for learning.

The priority map is generated using a novel combination of image features and class probabilities, which are computed using a pre-trained deep neural network. The features capture the spatial and spectral information of the image, while the class probabilities provide a measure of the model's confidence in its predictions.

Existing methods for image segmentation typically rely on fully-supervised learning approaches that require abundant high-quality labeled data. However, obtaining such annotations can be time-consuming and expensive, particularly for microscopy images where expertise in both imaging techniques and domain knowledge is required. In contrast, our proposed method exploits the idea of lazily labeling the data, where only a small portion of the dataset is manually annotated, while the remaining majority remains unaltered.

Our key insight is that, by appropriately augmenting the partially labeled data, we can learn a robust segmentation model without relying solely on fully annotated samples. To achieve this, we introduce a regularization term into the loss function that encourages the model to produce smooth predictions on the unlabeled data. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that our Lazy Labels Segmentation (LLS) framework outperforms traditional semi-supervised learning strategies and rivals performance of fully-supervised models trained on larger fully annotated datasets.

We evaluate LLS on several challenging microscopy image segmentation benchmarks. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves higher IoU scores using fewer annotations, demonstrating its potential to reduce annotation efforts and accelerate research progress in biomedical sciences. Furthermore, we demonstrate generalizability of LLS across various segmentation architectures and provide insights into the working mechanisms behind it.

The second stage is achieved through a reinforcement learning agent designed to learn an optimal policy for selecting the most informative instances based on their potential contribution to the model's accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGSS significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of segmentation accuracy while requiring fewer annotated examples.

This work has crucial implications for real-world applications where labeling data can be expensive and time-consuming. By employing MGSS, one can leverage large amounts of unlabeled data and reduce annotation efforts required for achieving high segmentation accuracy. Additionally, this study provides new insights into how different factors affect the efficiency of semi-supervised instance segmentation techniques, shedding light on previously overlooked aspects of the problem."

Abstract:

Accurate segmentation and reconstruction of the cardiac walls from computed tomography (CT) data is crucial for various cardiovascular applications, such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of cardiac diseases. However, the complexity and variability of the cardiac anatomy, as well as the limited resolution and quality of CT images, make this task challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach, called PC-U Net, which jointly reconstructs and segments the cardiac walls in 3D from CT data.

PC-U Net is built upon a U-Net architecture and incorporates a novel partitioned convolutional branch (PCB) to simultaneously learn the cardiac wall segmentation and 3D reconstruction. The PCB divides the input image into four sub-images, each of which is processed by a separate convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the corresponding cardiac wall. This allows the network to focus on the unique features and spatial relationships of each wall, leading to improved segmentation and reconstruction accuracy.

We evaluated PC-U Net on a dataset of 320 CT scans and compared its performance to state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that PC-U Net achieves superior segmentation and reconstruction accuracy, with a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.86 and a mean absolute error of 1.23 mm. In addition, we demonstrate the efficacy of PC-U Net in handling various challenges, such as low contrast, noise, and artifacts, and its potential for real-time application.

Our work has significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac diseases, as well as the development of personalized medicine. The accurate segmentation and reconstruction of the cardiac walls provided by PC-U Net can be used for quantitative assessment of cardiac function, detection of subtle cardiac abnormalities, and planning of minimally invasive procedures.

It is a key step in various applications such as object recognition, tracking, and scene understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to image segmentation using cellular automata (CA).

Cellular automata are a powerful tool for spatially distributed computing, where the entire image is divided into a grid of cells, and each cell applies a local rule based on the states of its neighboring cells. The application of CA to image segmentation has been largely unexplored, and our work aims to fill this gap.

We propose a simple and efficient algorithm that utilizes CA to segregate objects from the background and separate touching objects from each other. Our approach is based on a novel initialization technique that creates a random walker who moves around the image, interacting with the pixels and modifying their states according to a set of rules. This process iteratively refines the segmentation, gradually isolating objects from the surrounding pixels. We also introduce a new criterion for stopping the iteration, which ensures that the segmentation is accurate and robust.

The proposed method was tested on several benchmark images, including synthetic and real-world images, and the results were compared to those obtained using traditional image segmentation techniques such as thresholding and edge detection. The experimental outcome shows that our method outperforms these techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, it provides more coherent and visually appealing segmentations, especially in cases where objects have complex boundaries or shading variations.

They are able to learn rich feature representations from large datasets, leading to improved accuracy compared to traditional computer vision approaches. Moreover, they offer greater flexibility and generalization capabilities, allowing them to be applied to a wide range of images and scenarios.

However, our investigation also highlights several challenges and open issues in deep learning-based image segmentation. Firstly, we note that deep learning models require copious amounts of labeled training data, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Additionally, they can suffer from overfitting, especially when dealing with small datasets or minor variations in input images. Furthermore, interpretability and explainability remain significant concerns, making it difficult to understand why certain segmentation decisions are made.

However, annotating large amounts of data for deep learning models can be time-consuming and expensive, especially when working with diverse datasets from different domains. This paper proposes a novel approach called Dual-Teacher that integrates intra-domain and inter-domain teachers to improve annotation efficiency in cardiac segmentation tasks.

The proposed method combines a domain-specific teacher (DS-Teacher) and a domain-agnostic teacher (DA-Teacher) to leverage both intra-domain knowledge and inter-domain knowledge. The DS-Teacher is trained on manually annotated images within a specific domain, while the DA-Teacher is trained on a combination of annotations from multiple domains. By integrating these two teachers, the model can learnfrom both local and global patterns, leading to improved performance compared to using a single teacher.

Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the Dual-Teacher strategy. Compared to using only a single teacher, our method reduces the amount of manual annotation required by up to 50% while maintaining high accuracy levels. Furthermore, we show that the Dual-Teacher outperforms state-of-the-art methods that rely solely on intra-domain or inter-domain information.

Our findings demonstrate the potential of the Dual-Teacher framework for efficient cardiac segmentation in various scenarios where labeled data is limited or difficult to obtain.

The proposed model aims to overcome the limitations of traditional segmentation techniques that rely on hand-crafted features and fixed parameters, which can lead to suboptimal performance in certain applications.

The proposed model formulates image segmentation as a variational problem, where the goal is to minimize an energy functional that captures the underlying structure of the image.

The VIS model formulates image segmentation as a variational problem, where the goal is to minimize an energy function that incorporates both data fidelity and regularization terms. The energy function includes a normalized cut term that encourages the segmentation to be consistent with the image gradient information, an adaptive similarity term that captures the similarity between pixels in the same class, and a spatial regularization term that enforces smoothness of the segmentation boundary.

To solve the variational problem, we propose an efficient optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the segmentation mask and the auxiliary variables using a alternate direction method of multipliers. The algorithm ensures that the resulting segmentation masks are not only accurate but also consistent with the given image data.

Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of VIS compared to state-of-the-art image segmentation methods, including traditional algorithms such as thresholding, edge detection, and clustering, as well as deep learning-based approaches such as fully convolutional networks (FCN) and U-Net. Additionally, we show that VIS can handle real-world applications, such as medical imaging and object tracking, effectively.

Our method combines the benefits of optimal transport (OT) and entropic regularization (ER) to achieve high-quality segmentation while preserving the volume of the objects in the image.

OT is a powerful tool for image registration and segmentation, as it allows for the matching of images with different levels of detail and noise. However, traditional OT methods are not designed to preserve the volume of the objects in the image, which can result in distorted or shrunk objects. On the other hand, ER is a regularization technique that is used to stabilize the OT solution and improve its convergence properties. However, ER can also lead to over-smoothing and loss of details in the segmentation.

Our proposed EROT method addresses these limitations by combining the benefits of OT and ER in a novel way. We introduce an entropic regularization term that is carefully designed to preserve the volume of the objects in the image, while still providing the stabilizing effects of ER. We also propose an efficient algorithm to solve the EROT problem, which combines the Sinkhorn algorithm with a gradient descent scheme.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of EROT on several benchmark datasets, including the popular BSDS500 dataset.

Accurate segmentation of tumors and organs-at-risk is a crucial step in radiotherapy treatment planning. Deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown great promise in this regard. However, the success of these methods relies heavily on the quality and quantity of annotated data available for training. In this work, we propose a novel approach that exploits clinically available delineations to improve the performance of CNN-based segmentation models in radiotherapy treatment planning.

Abstract:

Image registration is a fundamental task in image processing that involves aligning multiple images of the same scene or object taken at different times or from different viewpoints. Traditional image registration methods rely on hand-crafted features and optimization techniques, which can be time-consuming and limited in their ability to handle complex deformations. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach called NeurReg, which leverages neural networks to learn a mapping between images and their corresponding transformations.

NeurReg consists of two main components: a registration network and a segmentation network. The registration network takes two images as input and outputs a transformation matrix that aligns the images. The segmentation network takes the aligned images as input and outputs a segmentation mask that separates the objects of interest from the background.

Abstract:

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to image registration called NeurReg, which leverages deep neural networks to learn a mapping between images. Unlike traditional methods that rely on hand-crafted features and optimization techniques, our approach learns a direct mapping from input images to their corresponding registered versions. This allows us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various registration tasks while also providing interpretability into the learned transformations.

We evaluate NeurReg on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in terms of both registration accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we explore the application of NeurReg to image segmentation tasks, where it achieves promising results by exploiting the preserved spatial information in the registered images. Our experiments show that NeurReg can accurately segment objects even when the training data is limited or contains variations in pose, illumination, or occlusion.

The key contribution of this work lies in the introduction of a deep learning framework for image registration, which not only improves registration precision but also enables a more robust feature extraction process. The presented experiments highlight the potential of NeurReg as a fundamental tool for image processing and computer vision applications.

Our main contributions are summarized as follows:

1. Introduction of NeurReg, a deep learning-based method for image registration that outperforms conventional approaches in term of accuracy and efficiency.
2. Demonstration of NeurReg's versatility through its application to diverse registration tasks (rigid, affine, and deformable) and dataset scenarios.
3. Exploration of NeurReg's ability to improve image segmentation performances by utilizing the preserved spatial information in registered images.
4. Presentation of comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with state-of-the-art registration methods, exhibiting NeurReg's superiority in various aspects."

Our proposed method, called Synseg-Net, leverages a combination of adversarial training and self-supervised learning to generate high-quality segmentations without the need for expensive and time-consuming manual annotation.

Existing methods for synthetic segmentation typically require large amounts of labeled data from the target modality (e.g., CT or MRI) to train their models. However, obtaining such labels is often challenging due to thecost and expertise required to manually delineate anatomical structures in medical images.

Our key innovation lies in introducing a new loss function based onadversarial training ,where the model is trainedto fool a domain discriminator into thinking the generated segmentations come from real target modality data rather than being artificially created . Additional regularization terms encourage the resulting segmentizations top be consistent with both the input image and knownanatomy knowledge.

Abstract:

Biomedical image segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging analysis, with applications in disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring. Deep learning-based methods have shown promising results in segmenting biomedical images, but they often suffer from limited accuracy and robustness, particularly when dealing with complex and varied images. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning architecture called ACE-Net, which stands for Augmented Contracting and Expansive Paths, to improve the accuracy and robustness of biomedical image segmentation.

ACE-Net is designed to address two main limitations of existing deep learning-based segmentation methods: (1) the lack of effective feature extraction and representation, and (2) the inability to handle complex and varied image structures. To address these limitations, ACE-Net introduces three key components: (1) augmented contracting paths, (2) expansive paths, and (3) feature pyramid networks.

Augmented contracting paths are designed to enhance feature extraction and representation by incorporating multi-scale and multi-orientation information into the network. Expansive paths are used to expand the receptive field of the network, enabling it to capture complex and varied image structures. Feature pyramid networks are employed to fuse low-level, middle-level, and high-level features, improving the network's ability to capture both local and global information.

ACE-Net is evaluated on several publicly available biomedical image segmentation datasets, including brain tumor segmentation, liver segmentation, and lung segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that ACE-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art segmentation methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness. Specifically, ACE-Net achieves an average dice similarity coefficient of 0.83 on the brain tumor segmentation dataset, an average dice similarity coefficient of 0.93 on the liver segmentation dataset, and an average dice similarity coefficient of 0.9"

In this paper, we present a novel deep learning architecture called ACE-Net (Augmented Contracting and Expansive Network), designed specifically for biomedical image segmentation tasks. The proposed network leverages both contracting and expansive paths to effectively captured spatial information and contextual details in medical images.

The contracting path of ACE-Net consists of convolutional layers that gradually reduce the spatial resolution while increasing the number of feature channels, allowing it to capture high-level semantic features from the input image. In contrast, the expansive path utilizes dilated convolutions and upsampling operations to increase the spatial resolution, enabling the network to recover fine details and precise boundaries.

Furthermore, we introduce an augmentation module that strategically duplicates and jitteres the input images during training, fostering the network's ability to generalize across various imaging protocols and artifacts. Additionally, we implement a skip connection mechanism between the contracting and expansive paths, facilitating the integration of multi-scale information and improving segmentation performance.

We evaluate ACE-Net on several publicly available datasets comprising diverse modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and microscopy images. Our experiments show that ACE-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods, demonstrating its superiority in accurately delineating complex structures and objects.

In contrast, AttentionBoost is a lightweight and flexible technique that can be easily integrated into existing FCN architectures without requiring extensive changes or additional training data.

The key idea behind AttentionBoost is to use boosting algorithms to learn a set of attention weights that highlight the most important regions in an image. These attention weights are then used to modify the input to the FCN, effectively guiding the network's focus towards the most informative areas. We evaluate AttentionBoost on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority compared to traditional FCNs and state-of-the-art attention-based models.

We introduce a deep neural network architecture that learns to predict the probability distribution over the possible segmentation masks given an image and its corresponding noisy label. During training, our model is trained to select the best segmentation mask from multiple choices, leveraging both accurate and erroneous annotations in the noisy dataset. At test time, the model can evaluate the quality of a given segmentation result based on the similarity between the predicted mask and the ground truth.

ET-Net is designed to address the problem of poor boundary detection in medical images, which is a critical task in various medical applications.

Existing deep learning models for medical image segmentation rely heavily on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) or U-Net-like architectures, which often produce blurry or incomplete boundaries. This is because these models are designed to focus on the feature extraction process rather than the boundary detection process.

ET-Net addresses this limitation by introducing an edge-aTtention mechanism that explicitly guides the network to learn the boundary information. The edge-aTtention mechanism is based on a novel attention module that learns to weight the importance of different image regions based on their relevance to the boundary. This allows the network to selectively focus on the boundary regions and produce more accurate segmentation results.

ET-Net is a generic architecture that can be easily adapted to different medical image segmentation tasks, such as tumor segmentation, organ segmentation, and vessel segmentation. We evaluate ET-Net on several publicly available datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The proposed network leverages both edge information and attention mechanisms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the segmentation process.

Existing segmentation methods often rely on heavily designed hand-crafted features or multi-scale feature pyramids, which can be suboptimal and computationally expensive. In contrast, our ET-Net utilizes a simple and effective approach that combines edge detection and attention mechanisms to selectively focus on the most relevant regions of the input images. This allows the network to learn richer representations at multiple scales and produce accurate segmentations with less computational overhead.

The key innovation of ET-Net lies in its ability to incorporate edge information into the attention mechanism. Specifically, we introduce an edge transformation module that converts the input image into a set of edge maps, each capturing different levels of edges. These edge maps are then used to compute attention weights, which are combined with the original image features to form a new set of hybrid features. This process not only enhances the representation capacity of the network but also reduces the risk of overfitting due to the regularizing effect of edge information.

Extensive experiments conducted on several publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of our ET-Net compared to state-of-the-art segmentation models. In particular, we achieve better performance than existing methods using fewer parameters and computations, highlighting the efficiency and scalability of our approach. Additionally, we provide thorough ablation studies and visualizations to analyze the contributions of various components in ET-Net, offering insights into the working mechanisms of the model.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to LA segmentation that combines global shape priors and autoencoding local intensity priors using a mixture modeling framework. Our approach leverages the strengths of both global and local prior knowledge to improve the accuracy and robustness of LA segmentation.

We first establish a global shape prior using a statistical shape model, which captures the average shape and variability of the LA across a population.

Global shape priors have been widely used in medical image segmentation tasks, as they can effectively capture the overall shape and structure of organs. However, they may not perform well when dealing with large variations in shape and size across different populations or when there is significant noise in the images. On the other hand, local intensity priors can capture detailed information about the texture and patterns within an organ, but may struggle to infer the global structure of the organ.

To address these limitations, we propose a mixture model that combines global shape priors and local intensity priors through an autoencoder-based framework. The proposed approach uses a variational inference scheme to learn a shared representation between the two types of priors, which enables the sharing of information across them. This allows our method to leverage the complementary information present in both types of priors to improve segmentation performance.

Biomedical image segmentation is a fundamental task in medical imaging analysis, which involves dividing an image into its constituent parts or structures. Accurate segmentation is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of various diseases. However, image segmentation remains challenging due to factors such as image complexity, variability, and noise.

Methodology:
To address these challenges, we propose a novel decoding method called Cascade Decoder, which is designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of biomedical image segmentation. The proposed method leverages the strengths of hierarchical representations and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to effectively capture spatial relationships between image pixels.

The Cascade Decoder consists of two main components: a hierarchy encoder and a cascade decoder. The hierarchy encoder extracts multi-scale features from the input image using a CNN, while the cascade decoder refines the segmentation results through a series of upsampling and convolution operations. Unlike traditional decoding methods that use a single upsample operation, our cascade decoder employs multiple upsamples with different dilation rates, allowing it to capture both local and global contextual information.

Results:
Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the Cascade Decoder over state-of-the-art segmentation methods. In particular, our method achieved improved performance on four publicly available datasets, includingCityscapes, PASCAL VOC, CamVid, and BSDS500. Quantitative evaluation metrics such as mean intersection over union (MIoU), dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to assess segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion:
Our proposed Cascade Decoder offers a universal decoding method for biomedical image segmentation, outperforming conventional approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Its ability to encode contextual information at multiple scales makes it particularly well-suited for handling complex images with varying levels of detail. With this advance, we can now better support clinicians and researchers in their efforts to analyze and interpret medical images. Future work includes exploring further optimizations and applying"

Existing methods for semantic segmentation of 3D MR images often rely on voxel-wise classification, which can be computationally expensive and may not fully capture the spatial relationships between different structures within the image. HDC addresses these limitations by decomposing the input volume into a set of lower-dimensional, non-overlapping feature maps that encode spatial information at multiple scales. These feature maps are then fed into a hierarchical CNN to learn high-level representations of the input data.

The key innovation of HDC is the use of a novel activation function that allows the network to selectively emphasize or suppress certain features based on their relevance to the task at hand. This results in improved performance compared to traditional CNNs, as well as reduced computational cost due to the fewer number of parameters required to represent the input data.

Accurate segmentation of brain structures from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans is crucial for studying brain development and identifying neurological disorders in infants. However, manual segmentation is time-consuming and subjective, leading to variability and inconsistency across different observers. To address this challenge, we propose an automated segmentation method based on deep learning techniques called Exclusive Independent Probability Estimation using Deep 3D Fully Convolutional DenseNets (EIPE-FCD).

Our proposed method combines a deep neural network architecture with a novel probability estimation technique that enables exclusive and independent probability estimation for each class label. This allows for accurate segmentation of multiple classes, including the challenging task of separating the cortical white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood vessels in infant brains. We evaluate our method on a large dataset of isointense infant brain MRIs and show that it outperforms state-of-the art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of different architectures and provide insights into the contribution of various design choices to the performance of the model.

Our results demonstrate that EIPE-FCD achieves high accuracy and robustness in segmenting brain structures from isointense infant brain MRIs, which has important implications for future studies investigating early brain development and neurological disorders. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily extended to other applications like image segmentation tasks in medical imaging or computer vision fields."

In contrast, our method treats the problems as interrelated and uses them to mutually improve each other. By iteratively refining object boundaries and motion estimates through careful cluster assignments, Foreground Clustering achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on several benchmark datasets while providing real-time performance.

The key idea is to construct an affinity graph that encodes appearance, spatial, and temporal information across frames and then applies spectral clustering to partition it into coherent foreground structures. These are then used to seed dense trajectory optimization, which revises object boundaries based on motion cues and enforces temporal consistency. This process alternates between clustering and tracking until convergence, where the final output consists of separated objects and their associated motion fields.

Extensive experiments show that Foreground Clustering outperforms existing methods under various scenarios, such as occlusions, cluttered scenes, shadows, and low light conditions.

Traditional segmentation methods are often limited by their inability to effectively handle objects that vary greatly in size, leading to inaccurate predictions and decreased performance. To address this issue, we propose an exponential logarithmic loss function (ExLL) that is specifically designed to handle large variations in object size.

The proposed method is based on a deep learning architecture that utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn features and predict class labels for each voxel in a 3D scene. The key innovation of our approach lies in the use of the ExLL loss function, which replaces the traditional cross-entropy loss used in most segmentation models. Unlike cross-entropy, which treats all classes equally, the ExLL loss function assigns a weighted penalty to misclassifications based on the relative size of the objects being segmented. This allows the model to pay more attention to smaller objects while still retaining accurate classification of larger objects.

We evaluate our method using several publicly available datasets containing 3D scans of urban scenes, indoor environments, and medical imaging data. Our results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in accurately segmenting objects across a wide range of sizes.

The proposed scheme combines the strengths of graph cuts and time series analysis to accurately segment liver tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

The proposed method consists of three stages: 1) preprocessing, 2) time series graph construction, and 3) graph cut segmentation. In the preprocessing stage, the MRI scans are processed to enhance the contrast between the tumor and the surrounding tissues. In the time series graph construction stage, a graph is built using the intensity values of the pixels in the MRI scans as nodes, and the similarity between the intensity values is used to define the edges. Finally, in the graph cut segmentation stage, the graph is partitioned into regions of similar intensity values, and the regions that correspond to the tumor are identified.

The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset of 20 MRI scans of liver tumors, and the results were compared to those obtained using traditional image segmentation methods. The results showed that the proposed method outperformed the traditional methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The mean accuracy of the proposed method was 93.2%, while the mean processing time was 30.5 seconds per image.

Abstract:

Accurate segmentation of medical images is a critical task in various medical applications, including disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promising results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, the success of CNNs largely depends on the architecture design, which requires a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel nested U-Net architecture, called UNet++, for medical image segmentation.

The proposed UNet++ architecture combines the strengths of the U-Net and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architectures, while addressing their limitations. UNet++ consists of multiple nested U-Net modules, where each module is composed of a contraction path and an expansion path. The contraction path consists of a series of convolutional and max-pooling layers, followed by a batch normalization layer and a ReLU activation function. The expansion path consists of a series of convolutional and upsampling layers, followed by a batch normalization layer and a ReLU activation function. The output of each module is passed through a skip connection, which helps to preserve spatial information and improve feature representation.

We evaluated the performance of UNet++ on three publicly available medical image segmentation datasets: BraTS (brain tumor segmentation), LiTS (liver tumor segmentation), and KiTS (kidney tumor segmentation). Our experimental results show that UNet++ outperforms several state-of-the-art segmentation models, including U-Net, FCN, and SegNet, in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, UNet++ achieved an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.83, 0.85, and 0.87 on the BraTS, LiTS, and KiTS datasets, respectively, while maintaining a low computational cost.

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

The U-Net architecture has been widely used for segmenting medical images, but its limitations, such as poor performance on small objects and lack of contextual information, have been well-documented.

The proposed UNet++ addresses these limitations by incorporating a nested U-Net structure that utilizes multi-scale features to improve segmentation accuracy. The nested U-Net consists of an outer network that captures high-level contextual information and an inner network that focuses on low-level detailed information. The two networks are connected through skip connections, allowing them to share information and work collaboratively.

Experiments were conducted using several publicly available datasets, including segmenting tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, detecting diabetic retinopathy in fundus images, and identifying cells in microscopy images. The results demonstrated that UNet++ outperformed state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement in mean intersection over union (MIOU) of up to 10% compared to the original U-Net.

Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of different components of the U-Net++ architecture and found that both the outer and inner networks contributed significantly to the improved performance. Ablation studies also showed that theskip connections between the two networks were crucial for combining local and global information effectively.

Our findings suggest that the nested U-Net architecture offers a promising direction for improving medical image segmentation models. The use of multiple scales and shared information can lead to better feature representation, resulting in more accurate and robust segmentation.

Our main contribution is the introduction of a new regularization method, called Function Norm Regularization (FNR), which explicitly controls the function norms of the network layers to improve generalization. FNR is based on the insight that different function norms are optimal for different layers of the network, depending on their position in the feedforward process. By adjusting these norms accordingly, we can significantly reduce overfitting and improve overall performance.

We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and compare it with existing state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that FNR achieves superior performance compared to other regularization techniques while also providing better interpretability of the learned functions. To further support our findings, we conduct an ablation study and analyze the behavior of FNR under various hyperparameter settings.

Medical images are often acquired using multiple modalities, such as X-ray, CT, and MRI, each providing complementary information about the body's internal structures. However, integrating these modalities into a single segmentation model can be challenging due to differences in intensity values, resolutions, and artifacts.

To address this challenge, we developed a multi-modal CNN that incorporates image fusion techniques to learn features from separate modality images and fuse them in a hierarchical manner.

We evaluated our approach on several publicly available datasets containing multimodal images, including brain tumor and cardiac datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods by effectively leveraging the strengths of various modalities. Particularly, the hybrid fusion strategy achieves the best performance, improving overall segmentation accuracy by 5% compared to the best-performing monomodal baseline.

Abstract:

Accurate segmentation of medical images is a crucial step in various medical applications, including disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring. However, manual segmentation is time-consuming and challenging, especially for complex anatomical structures. In this paper, we propose a novel deep interactive geodesic framework, called DeepIGeoS, for medical image segmentation.

DeepIGeoS combines the strengths of deep learning and interactive geodesic methods to provide accurate and efficient segmentation. Our framework consists of a deep neural network that learns the underlying anatomy from a set of unsegmented images, and an interactive geodesic algorithm that incorporates user feedback to refine the segmentation results. The neural network is trained on a large dataset of medical images and their corresponding manual segmentations. Once the network is trained, the interactive geodesic algorithm takes the output of the network as an initial segmentation and allows the user to interact with the image, adjusting the segmentation boundaries to improve accuracy.

We evaluate the performance of DeepIGeoS on several medical image datasets, including brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans, lung tumor segmentation from CT scans, and vessel segmentation from retinal fundus images. Our results show that DeepIGeoS outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we conduct a user study to evaluate the usability of DeepIGeoS and find that users are able to quickly and accurately segment medical images with minimal training.

DeepIGeoS has the potential to revolutionize medical image segmentation by providing a fast, accurate, and user-friendly framework for clinicians and researchers. With its ability to incorporate user feedback, DeepIGeoS can adapt to various medical imaging modalities and anatomical structures, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of medical applications."

Unlike traditional deep learning models that rely on passive learning strategies, DeepIGeoS incorporates active contours and level sets to actively interact with the image data and learn from user annotations.

The proposed method consists of three stages: (1) an initialization stage where the model generates an initial segmentation mask using a 3D CNN; (2) an interaction stage where the user adjusts the segmentation mask by inputting intuitive commands such as points, lines, or surfaces; and (3) a refinement stage where the model updates the segmentation mask based on the user's feedback. The core idea is to iteratively refine the segmentation mask through a series of interactive operations until the desired accuracy is reached.

We evaluate the performance of DeepIGeoS on several publicly available datasets, including brain tumor, liver segmentation, and lung segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art fully automated methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, DeepIGeoS achieves an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.93 and 0.86 for brain and liver segmentation, respectively, while reducing the annotation time by around 50%.

First, it allows users to correct errors caused by artifacts or complex structures that may mislead deep learning models. Second, it provides more accurate segmentations than fully automated methods since users can provide domain knowledge and expertise during the interaction process.

This method leverages the strengths of both 3D and 2D image registration techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of label fusion in medical imaging.

Existing label fusion methods rely on manual segmentation of structures of interest or use simplistic intensity-based registration strategies that are limited by their reliance on a single modality or time point. Our proposed method addresses these limitations by utilizing a combination of 2D and 3D registrations between longitudinal images to estimate deformable transformations that align corresponding structures across modalities and time points. We integrate information from multiple atlases, each containing expert annotations for different organs and tissues, to generate a comprehensive map of labels that account for inter-subject variability and temporal changes.

Our core hypothesis is that the integration of multi-modal information through 4D registration enables more accurate and robust label fusion than traditional methods. To validate our approach, we perform experiments on several public datasets including brain MRIs with four modalities (T1w, T2w, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)) and whole-body CT scans with two modalities (soft tissue and bone). The results demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with an average Dice score improvement of 0.17 for intra-modal brain structures and 0.25 for inter-modal whole-body structures.

Accurate detection of crops and weeds is crucial in agriculture for precision farming, crop yield prediction, and herbicide application. However, manual annotation of large datasets for training machine learning models is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose an automatic model-based dataset generation approach that rapidly generates labeled datasets for fast and accurate crop and weed detection.

Our method leverages a simulation environment that mimics various agricultural scenarios, including different weather conditions, soil types, and crop varieties. By simulating a growing season, we generate RGB images and corresponding labels for crops and weeds using a physics-based model.

The proposed technique leverages the strengths of traditional edge detection methods while improving upon their limitations by incorporating local adaptation. The technique is based on the observation that edges in an image can be better detected by adapting to the local properties of the image, such as texture and contrast, rather than relying solely on global thresholding techniques.

The proposed method consists of two stages: (1) feature extraction, where relevant features are extracted from the image, and (2) boundary detection, where the features are used to detect edges in the image. In the feature extraction stage, the technique uses a combination of gradient operators and Gabor filters to capture both low-frequency and high-frequency information in the image. These features are then combined into a single feature map, which captures the most relevant information for boundary detection.

In the boundary detection stage, the technique applies a local adaptation mechanism, which adjusts the threshold values for each pixel based on the local properties of the image. Specifically, the threshold values are adjusted based on the distribution of intensities in the neighboring pixels, allowing the technique to adapt to changes in contrast and texture.

Experiments conducted on a dataset of images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique compared to traditional edge detection methods. The results show that the locally adapting technique outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness to noise. Furthermore, the technique is able to preserve thin boundaries and handle complex scenes with varying lighting conditions.

Overall, this paper introduces a novel approach to boundary detection using image segmentation that leverages local adaptation to improve the accuracy and robustness of the technique. The proposed method has important applications in various fields, including object recognition, tracking, and scene understanding."

Brain parcellation is the process of dividing the brain into distinct regions, each with its own unique characteristics and functions. This task is of great importance in neuroscience, as it can help researchers to better understand the structure and function of the brain, and to identify biomarkers for various neurological and psychiatric conditions.

3D CNNs have shown great promise in addressing this task, due to their ability to learn rich and hierarchical representations of 3D data. However, their computational requirements can be prohibitively expensive, and their performance can suffer from overfitting.

Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves assigning labels to pixels in an image to identify objects or regions of interest. Accurate segmentation is critical in various applications, including object recognition, tracking, and scene understanding.

Traditional image segmentation methods rely on hand-crafted features and shallow learning models, which have limited representation capacity and are unable to capture complex contextual relationships between pixels. Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promising results in image segmentation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods are typically trained using cross-entropy loss functions, which are not optimized for segmentation tasks and may produce over-smoothed or over-segmented results.

In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, called the Tversky loss function, which is specifically designed for image segmentation tasks. The Tversky loss function combines the benefits of both cross-entropy and intersection-over-union (IoU) loss functions, and is able to capture the spatial relationship between pixels. We also propose a new architecture for 3D FCNs that leverages the Tversky loss function to improve segmentation accuracy.

Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves dividing an image into its constituent parts or objects, which can be helpful in various applications such as object recognition, tracking, and scene understanding.

Traditionally, FCNs have been widely used for image segmentation tasks due to their ability to learn rich feature representations from raw image data. However, their performance can be limited by the choice of loss function used during training. The most commonly used loss functions for image segmentation are Intersection over Union (IoU) and Cross-Entropy (CE), but they have some limitations. IoU is sensitive to class imbalance issues, whereas CE treats all classes equally, ignoring their relative importance.

To address these limitations, we propose the use of the Tversky loss function, which was originally designed for anomaly detection and segmentation tasks. The Tversky loss function modifies the standard CE loss function by introducing a parameter that controls the balance between precision and recall, allowing the model to focus on either precise segmentation of smaller regions or loose segmentation of larger regions.

We conduct experiments on two public datasets: Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012. Our results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation models trained with traditional loss functions, achieving better segmentation accuracy while also showing improved robustness to class imbalance issues. We evaluate our approach using different values of the Tversky parameter and provide ablation studies to analyze the contribution of each component in our framework.

Our findings suggest that the Tversky loss function can be an effective alternative to traditional loss functions for image segmentation tasks, providing a new tool for improving segmentation accuracy in complex scenes. This work paves the way for exploring other non-traditional loss functions that could potentially benefit image segmentation tasks, and highlights the need for further investigation into the design and analysis of specialized loss functions tailored to specific application domains."

Abstract:

Medical image segmentation is a crucial step in various medical applications, such as disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring. With the advent of deep learning techniques, there has been significant progress in automating this process, especially with the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most existing works focus on single-modal image segmentation, where the model is trained on images from only one modality. In reality, many medical imaging modalities are available, each providing complementary information about the body. This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework for multi-task medical image segmentation that combines multiple modalities to improve segmentation accuracy and robustness.

Our proposed method leverages a shared encoder-decoder architecture to jointly learn features across different modalities, which are then used to perform task-specific segmentations. We explore different fusion strategies to combine the modalities, including early, late, and hybrid fusion methods. Additionally, we introduce a novel loss function designed specifically for multi-task segmentation tasks, which considers both inter-modality consistency and intra-modality quality. A thorough evaluation on several public datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results show an improvement in segmentation performance when using multiple modalities, and highlight the benefits of sharing knowledge across tasks and modalities.

This work has important implications for clinical applications where accurate segmentation is critical, such as tumor detection, organ segmentation, and non-invasive diagnostics. We envision our framework to be adapted and further refined for various medical image segmentation tasks, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes and improved usage of medical imaging data."

It is a challenging problem, especially when dealing with complex images, and requires accurate and efficient algorithms to achieve high-quality segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to image segmentation based on combinatorial energy learning.

Combinatorial energy learning is a machine learning framework that combines the strengths of both combinatorial optimization and energy-based learning. It has been successfully applied to various problems, including image segmentation, but its potential for this task has not been fully explored. In this paper, we develop a combinatorial energy learning algorithm specifically designed for image segmentation, which we call Combinatorial Energy Segmentation (CES).

CES formulates image segmentation as a combinatorial optimization problem, where the goal is to find the optimal partition of the image into regions of similar properties. The algorithm uses a novel energy function that captures the spatial relationships between pixels and encourages the formation of coherent regions. The energy function is designed to be flexible and can incorporate various image features, such as color, texture, and edge information.

The CES algorithm iteratively optimizes the energy function using a combination of gradient descent and combinatorial optimization techniques. The algorithm starts with an initial segmentation and iteratively refines it by moving pixels between regions, merging or splitting regions, and adjusting the region boundaries. The optimization process is guided by the energy function, which ensures that the resulting segmentation is consistent with the image features and satisfies the spatial constraints.

Electron microscopy images are highly complex and require accurate segmentation for feature extraction and analysis. However, obtaining annotated data for supervised learning is challenging due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of manual annotation.

To address this challenge, we propose SSHMT, which leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to learn a hierarchical representation of the image. The proposed method consists of two main components: a semi-supervised learning framework that learns a hierarchy of features from the labeled data, and a merge tree that combines the features from different levels of the hierarchy to segment the image.

The semi-supervised learning framework is based on a deep neural network that takes both labeled and unlabeled data as input. The network learns to predict the labels for the labeled data and simultaneously learns a representation of the unlabeled data. The learned representation is then used to construct a hierarchy of features by clustering similar features together.

The merge tree is a novel data structure that enables efficient and effective segmentation of the image. The tree is constructed by recursively partitioning the image into smaller regions based on the similarity of the features. Each node in the tree represents a region of the image, and the leaf nodes correspond to the smallest regions that can be segmented. The merge tree allows for efficient propagation of labels from the labeled data to the unlabeled data, enabling accurate segmentation of the entire image.

Traditional image segmentation methods suffer from limited performance due to their reliance on hand-crafted features and inability to effectively capture contextual information. To address these limitations, we introduce a new architecture that combines the strengths of superpixel convolutional networks (SCNs) and bilateral inceptions.

SCNs are a type of deep learning model that partition an image into superpixels, which are clusters of pixels that share similar visual features. By operating on superpixels instead of individual pixels, SCNs can capture contextual information and produce more accurate segmentation masks. However, existing SCNs suffer from limited performance due to their simple architecture and lack of sophisticated feature extraction capabilities.

Bilateral inceptions, on the other hand, are a type of deep learning building block that have shown great success in image classification tasks. They are designed to capture multi-scale contextual information by concatenating feature maps from different scales and then applying a series of convolutional layers. However, bilateral inceptions have not been explored for image segmentation tasks.

Our proposed method, called Superpixel Convolutional Networks using Bilateral Inceptions (SCN-BI), combines the strengths of both SCNs and bilateral inceptions. We integrate bilateral inceptions into the SCN architecture to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the model. The bilateral inceptions are applied to each superpixel, allowing the model to capture both local and global contextual information.

The proposed architecture aims to improve the performance of CNNs in image classification tasks by exploiting the spatial structure of images through superpixels and bilateral inceptions.

Traditional CNNs use small fixed-size filters that may not effectively capture large-scale features, leading to reduced accuracy in ImageNet-like datasets. To address this limitation, SCN-BI introduces superpixels, which partition an image into regions of similar texture and color, allowing the network to capture larger-scale features while preserving local information.

Furthermore, the authors propose bilateral inceptions, which adapt the Inception module from the Inception Network to operate on superpixels instead of individual pixels. By combining multi-scale filters and lateral connections within each bilateral inception, the network can learn richer feature representations across different scales and directions.

The proposed SCN-BI model is evaluated on several benchmark datasets including CIFAR10 and ImageNet. Experimental results demonstrate that SCN-BI outperforms state-of-the-art architectures such as ResNeXt and DenseNet, achieving an error rate of 3.54% on ImageNet with significantly fewer parameters.

Existing methods often rely on low-level features and laborious post-processing steps, resulting in slow performance and suboptimal accuracy. Our method leverages recent advances in deep learning to efficiently capture high-order contextual information and employs guided filtering to refine the segmentation results.

We begin by introducing a new architecture that integrates a high-order context encoder with a feature pyramid network (HPN) backbone. The HPN extracts multi-scale features from the input image, while the context encoder captures long-range dependencies using a hierarchical convolutional kernel. We then employ a novel guided filtering module that selectively emphasizes relevant regions based on the output of the context encoder. This allows the model to focus on the most discriminative areas when segments objects or boundaries.

On several benchmark datasets (Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and COCO), our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it achieves an improvement of X% in mIoU on Cityscapes and Y% in mAP on COCO without requiring additional annotation or training data. Our ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both the high-order context encoder and the guided filtering mechanism. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method--it can be trained using a single GPU within a reasonable time frame while maintaining competitive performance. 

The main contributions of this work are:
1. A novel deep learning architecture that jointly learns high-order context and features via a hierarchical convolutional kernel; 
2. An efficient guided filtering module that adaptively weights feature responses according to their relevance; 3. State-of-the=art performance on multiple public datasets with minimal computational resources.

Our approach leverages the strengths of both top-down and bottom-up methods to improve the accuracy and efficiency of salient object detection.

Existing top-down methods rely solely on the spatial relationships between objects and the context, which can be limited in certain scenarios, such as when objects are heavily occluded or have similar appearance. In contrast, bottom-up methods rely on the feature extraction and classification of individual objects, which can be computationally expensive and may not capture the global context.

Our CG-TDS approach combines the strengths of both methods by using a classifier to guide the top-down search for salient objects. Specifically, we first use a classifier to identify the most likely object categories present in the image, and then use this information to guide the top-down search for salient objects. We propose a novel algorithm that iteratively refines the object proposals based on their compatibility with the predicted object categories, resulting in more accurate and efficient salient object detection.

We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art top-down and bottom-up methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Our approach also demonstrates better robustness to occlusion and clutter, and is able to handle complex scenes with multiple salient objects.

Our approach leverages a classification model to predict the location and category of salient objects in an image, while also using a gradient-based method to refine the boundaries of the predicted regions.

Existing SOD approaches typically rely on bottom-up or top-down designs, each with its own limitations. Bottom-up approaches first generate a set of region proposals and then apply classifiers to identify salient objects, but may produce redundant or incomplete detections due to their non-selective nature. Top-down approaches directly predict a saliency map from the full image, but often struggle with accurate localization and categorization of salient objects.

Our proposed method bridges the gap between these two paradigms by integrating classifier guidance into a top-down framework. Specifically, we adapt a pre-trained classifier to predict the position and type of salient objects in the image, followed by a novel gradient-based refinement step that utilizes the output from the classifier to improve boundary accuracy. We term our approach ""Classifier-guided Top-down Salient Object Detection"" (CGTSD).

The key advantages of CGTSD are:

1. Improved efficiency: By leveraging a pre-trained classifier, our approach reduces computational complexity compared to training a dedicated SOD model from scratch.
2. Enhanced accuracy: The integrated classifier guidance helps refine the boundaries of salient objects, leading to improved precision and recall.
3. Robustness to occlusion and clutter: CGTSD is able to handle complex scenarios with multiple overlapping objects, occlusions, and distractors, thanks to the hierarchical nature of the classifier.
4. Flexibility: Our top-down design allows for natural extensions towards video SOD, instance segmentation, and other related tasks.

Our proposed method, called HDP-DBSCAN, combines the probabilistic nature of Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDP-clustering) with the robustness of Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). This hybrid approach enables us to capture the spatial heterogeneity of images while efficiently handling noise and outliers.

We evaluate the performance of HDP-DBSCAN on several benchmark datasets, including synthetic and real-world images, and compare it with state-of-the-art clustering-based image segmentation methods.

The proposed method, called Evolving Fuzzy Image Segmentation (EFIS), combines the strengths of fuzzy logic and evolutionary algorithms to optimize the segmentation process.

Fuzzy image segmentation is a popular technique used to address the uncertainty associated with image segmenation tasks. However, conventional fuzzy segmentation methods are often criticized for their fixed membership functions, which can be suboptimal for certain images or applications. To overcome this limitation, EFIS introduces an evolving mechanism that adaptively adjusts the membership functions based on the image features and user feedback.

The proposed EFIS algorithm consists of three main stages: (1) initialization, (2) evolution, and (3) validation. In the initialization stage, the algorithm generates an initial set of membership functions using a Gaussian function. In the evolution stage, the algorithm iteratively adjusts the membership functions using a genetic algorithm, where the fitness function is defined as the segmentation accuracy. During each iteration, the algorithm evaluates the quality of the resulting segments and provides visual feedback to the user, who can then adjust the membership functions accordingly. Finally, in the validation stage, the algorithm validates the evolved membership functions using a test dataset to ensure their robustness and effectiveness.

Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of EFIS over state-of-the-art fuzzy image segmentation techniques. Specifically, EFIS achieves higher segmentation accuracy while also providing improved interpretability and flexibility compared to traditional methods. Additionally, a usability study shows that users are generally satisfied with the evolved membership functions and find them easier to understand and adjust than those obtained from traditional methods.

Overall, the proposed EFIS algorithm represents a significant advancement in fuzzy image segmentation by incorporating self-configuration capabilities that improve its performance and adaptability. The evolutionary approach enables the algorithm to automatically adjust the membership functions according to the image characteristics, leading to better segmentation results and enhanced user experience."

Our proposed algorithm, called the Tiered Move-making Algorithm (TMA), is designed to efficiently explore the solution space and identify high-quality moves that minimize the energy function.

Unlike traditional methods that rely on iterative local search or linear programming relaxations, TMA employs a tiered structure to guide the search process. The algorithm starts by initializing a set of tiers, each containing a subset of the particles in the system. It then iteratively performs moves that exchange particles between tiers, following a carefully designed set of rules that ensure the energy function is non-increasing.

The key insight behind TMA is that the tiers serve as a coarse-graining of the solution space, allowing the algorithm to quickly explore the space and identify promising regions. By exchanging particles between tiers, TMA can effectively navigate the complex landscape of the energy function and avoid getting stuck in local minima.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of TMA through extensive simulations on a variety of non-submodular pairwise energy functions.

Abstract:

Accurate segmentation of live-wire 3D medical images is a critical task in various medical applications, including disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring. However, achieving high accuracy in segmenting these images remains a challenging problem due to factors such as image noise, artifacts, and complex anatomical structures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines deep learning and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to segment live-wire 3D medical images. Our proposed method leverages the strengths of both techniques to provide accurate and robust segmentation results.

Firstly, we employ a pre-trained deep learning model to extract features from the input data. These features are then used to initialize the PINNs, which incorporate physical knowledge about the imaging process and the underlying anatomy. The PINNs refine the initial segmentation masks produced by the deep learning model and generate high-quality segmentations. We validate our approach using several publicly available datasets and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Our key contributions include:

1. Introduction of a hybrid framework that integrates deep learning and PINNs for live-wire 3D medical image segmentation;
2. Development of a novel loss function that incorporates both image intensity and spatial information to improve segmentation accuracy;
3. Demonstration of the effectiveness of our approach on diverse medical datasets, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US);
4. Evaluation of our method's robustness against various types of noise and artifacts commonly found in medical images.

The proposed method has significant implications for advancing the fields of medical imaging analysis and computer vision. It can be applied to various tasks, such as tumor detection, organ segmentation, and image-guided interventions. Moreover, our approach can potentially facilitate the development of personalized medicine by providing more precise and individualized diagnostic tools.

Low DOF images are challenging for segmentation due to the blurred boundaries between objects and the background, which can lead to errors in segmentation algorithms. Our proposed method addresses this challenge by combining a deep learning-based approach with a novel feature called ""spatial pyramid pooling"" (SPP) to improve the accuracy and robustness of image segmentation in low DOF images.

The proposed method consists of two stages: 1) SPP feature extraction, and 2) segmentation using a deep neural network. In the first stage, the SPP feature is extracted from the low DOF image, which captures the spatial information of the image at multiple scales. In the second stage, the SPP feature is fed into a deep neural network, which is trained to perform image segmentation. The network uses a combination of convolutional and recurrent layers to learn the spatial and contextual information of the image, and produces a segmentation mask as output.

We evaluate the proposed method on several benchmark datasets, including both synthetic and real-world low DOF images. The results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness.

However, achieving accurate segmentation in low depth of field (DoF) images remains a significant challenge due to the blurred and ambiguous information in the background. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to robust image segmentation in low DoF images, which leverages both color and texture cues to improve segmentation accuracy.

Our proposed method consists of two stages: (1) color-based segmentation and (2) texture-based segmentation. In the first stage, we employ acolor-based segmentation algorithm that utilizes the color information of the image to separate the object of interest from the background. We then apply anovel color filtering technique to remove any artifacts caused by chromatic aberrations and noise. In the second stage, we use atexture-based segmentation algorithm that exploits the spatialinformation in the image to refine the segmentation results. Our approach combines local binary patterns with aSupport Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to accurately distinguish between the object andBackground textures.

Motility is a crucial aspect of the behavior of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, and its analysis can provide valuable insights into the neural control of locomotion and the effects of environmental factors on animal behavior. However, quantifying motility in C. elegans can be challenging, especially when the worms are exposed to different environmental conditions. In this paper, we present a novel approach to estimating motility in C. elegans using a multi-environment model that takes into account the effects of various environmental factors on locomotion.

Our approach involves using computer vision techniques to track the movement of worms in multiple environments, including different temperatures, concentrations of chemicals, and substrate textures. We then use a machine learning algorithm to identify the features of worm movement that are most relevant for quantifying motility and to develop a model that can accurately estimate motility across different environments.

We validate our approach using a dataset of C. elegans worms exposed to different temperatures and show that our model can accurately predict motility in new environments that were not used during training. We also demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a dataset of worms exposed to different concentrations of a chemical that affects locomotion.

Our results show that the multi-environment model provides a more accurate estimate of motility than a single-environment model and that it can be used to identify specific environmental factors that affect locomotion. This approach has the potential to be used in high-throughput screening assays to identify genes and drugs that affect motility and to better understand the neural control of locomotion in C. elegans.

Our approach is based on the idea of maximizing the mutual information between clusters, which is a measure of the similarity between the clusters. We show that the min-cut algorithm can be interpreted as a method for finding the optimal clustering that maximizes the mutual information, subject to a constraint on the total edge weight between clusters.

We begin by defining a probabilistic model for the graph, in which each node is assigned a random variable representing its cluster membership. We then derive an expression for the mutual information between clusters, which is a function of the cluster assignments and the edge weights between nodes. We show that the min-cut algorithm can be seen as a method for finding the cluster assignments that maximize the mutual information, subject to the constraint that the total edge weight between clusters is minimized.

We also prove that the min-cut algorithm is equivalent to a variational inference algorithm, which is a method for approximating the true posterior distribution over the cluster assignments. This equivalence provides a theoretical justification for the use of min-cut clustering, and suggests that it can be seen as a form of approximate inference in a probabilistic model.

  domains"".","The abstract of an academic paper should provide a brief summary of the research question, methodology, results, and contributions of the paper. Here's an example of an abstract for a paper titled ""Effective results for Diophantine equations over finitely generated domains"":

In this paper, we investigate the solvability of Diophantine equations over finitely generated domains, and provide effective results for finding solutions to such equations. We present a new method that combines techniques from algebraic number theory and computational algebra to effectively solve Diophantine equations over finitely generated domains. Our approach is based on the use of finitely generated modules and the theory of Diophantine approximation, and allows us to provide effective bounds for the solutions of Diophantine equations.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to several families of Diophantine equations, including equations with rational coefficients and equations over number fields. In particular, we show that our method can effectively solve certain Diophantine equations that are not solvable by traditional methods, such as the classical method of descent.

Our results have important implications for the study of Diophantine equations and their applications in number theory, algebraic geometry, and computer science. In particular, our work provides a new tool for studying the arithmetic of finitely generated domains, and demonstrates the power of combining algebraic and computational methods in number theory.

Overall, our paper provides a significant contribution to the study of Diophantine equations over finitely generated domains, and opens up new avenues for research in this area."

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving Diophantine equations over finitely generated domains. Our method leverages recent advances in algebraic geometry and number theory to provide effective solutions to these equations, which are widely used in various fields such as cryptography, coding theory, and computational complexity.

We establish a general framework for tackling Diophantine equations over finitely generated domains, and demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to several important examples. Our approach combines techniques from geometric invariant theory, toric varieties, and the study of zeta functions to achieve efficient algorithms for finding integer solutions to Diophantine equations.

One of the key contributions of our work is the development of a new notion of Diophantine forgetfulness, which allows us to reduce the dimension of the search space and significantly improve the efficiency of our algorithm. We also introduce a new technique called ""Diophantine rebooting,"" which enables us to restart the algorithm from a different starting point and overcome obstacles that may arise during the computation.

Our experiments show that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both running time and memory usage. We also provide thorough analysis of the complexity of our algorithm, including tradeoffs between runtime and memory requirements.

Our work has significant implications for many areas of computer science and mathematics, including cryptography, coding theory, computational complexity, and optimization. It provides a powerful tool for solving Diophantine equations over finitely generated domains, enabling new applications and advancements in these fields."

We begin by introducing the basic concepts and tools of generalized complex geometry, including the notion of a generalized complex manifold and the associated notion of a generalized holomorphic vector bundle. We then turn our attention to the study of blow-ups in this context, developing a framework for understanding the behavior of blow-ups in generalized complex geometry.

Our main result is the construction of a blow-up formula for generalized complex manifolds, which generalizes the classical blow-up formula from complex geometry. We demonstrate the application of this formula by studying several examples of blow-ups in generalized complex geometry, including the blow-up of a generalized complex manifold along a submanifold and the blow-up of a generalized complex vector bundle over a base manifold.

We also explore the relationship between blow-ups in generalized complex geometry and other areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry and differential geometry. In particular, we show how the blow-up formula for generalized complex manifolds can be used to study the geometry and topology of algebraic varieties and to understand the behavior of differential operators on generalized complex manifolds.

Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive introduction to blow-ups in generalized complex geometry and demonstrates the power and flexibility of this approach to studying geometric objects and their properties. The results and techniques presented here have important implications for a wide range of fields, from algebraic geometry and differential geometry to mathematical physics and string theory."

We show that the notion of a blow-up can be extended to this setting and that it has rich geometric and algebraic structure.

We first introduce the concept of a generalized complex manifold, which is a manifold equipped with a collection of complex structures that satisfy certain compatibility conditions. We then define the notion of a blow-up in this context, generalizing the classical notion of a blow-up of a complex manifold.

We prove that blow-ups in generalized complex geometry share many properties with their classical counterparts. For example, they are still characterized by the existence of a exceptional divisor, which is now a codimension-two submanifold with a normal bundle that is a direct sum of line bundles. We also show that blow-ups preserve various topological invariants, such as the fundamental group and the cohomology ring.

However, we also demonstrate that there are important differences between classical and generalized complex blow-ups. For instance, the latter can have a more intricate singularity structure, with non-isomorphicExceptional divisors that intersect each other in a non-trivial way. Moreover, we show that blow-ups in generalized complex geometry can arise from different types of degenerations, including both holomorphic and non-holomorphic ones.

Our results shed new light on the nature of blow-ups in complex geometry and pave the way for further research in this area. They also open up new possibilities for studying the geometry and topology of spaces with multiple complex structures, which have applications in areas such as string theory and mirror symmetry.

In addition to our main results, we provide a detailed analysis of several examples of blow-ups in generalized complex geometry, illustrating their diverse behavior and highlighting their connections to other areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and number theory."

By arranging the tetrahedra in a specific manner, we are able to achieve a densely packed structure that exhibits long-range order and symmetry, yet lacks the periodicity of a traditional crystal.

Our approach involves the creation of a network of mutually perpendicular golden rectangles, which are then used as the building blocks for the tetrahedral packing. By carefully arranging the rectangles and the tetrahedra, we are able to achieve a packing density of greater than 90%, significantly higher than that of any previously known tetrahedral packing.

The resulting quasicrystal exhibits a number of unique properties, including a high degree of symmetry and a lack of defects. We demonstrate that the structure is stable and can be grown in a controlled manner, making it a promising candidate for a variety of applications, including materials science and photonic devices.

Our work represents a significant advancement in the field of quasicrystal research, and opens up new avenues for the study of non-periodic structures and their properties. The techniques developed in this work have the potential to be applied to a wide range of fields, including materials science, chemistry, and physics."
